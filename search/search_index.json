Below is the staking screen, and you can see that you'll be rewarded with an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 35%. This is very high compared to other staking services, and it's worth exploring how this is possible. Rewards are given in Grass tokens, but where do these tokens come from? Since there is no inflation in the token economy, we can speculate that a portion of the total supply to be issued is being paid out as rewards. Since it's early in the service, it seems to be a strategy to promote people to stake Grass tokens at a high APR to reduce the circulating supply and defend the price. However, once enough tokens are staked, the reward is expected to be lowered.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#5-project-status-plan","title":"5.

It also provides transparency with respect to the verification of data provenance.</p> <p>On-chain is the best way to ensure that everyone can verify that the distribution of tokens based on contributions is fair.

Insights &amp; Limitations","text":""},{"location":"reports/grass/#key-takeaways","title":"\u2705 Key Takeaways","text":"<ul> <li>A clever solution to the problem of IP blocking in web crawling by crowdsourcing the devices of ordinary users.</li> <li>Crowdsourcing idle device resources is an old idea. Projects like SETI@Home and Folding@Home have utilized idle resources, and software like BOINC is often used. These projects are called Volunteer Computing because people participate voluntarily without compensation. Grass, on the other hand, is used for the commercial purpose of web crawling and incentivizes participation by rewarding participants with Grass tokens.</li> <li>For crowdsourcing, where nodes are scattered around the world, tokens are the most appropriate way to reward them. Traditional fiat money transfers would be nearly impossible to implement. It is difficult to implement because you need to verify the customer and adapt to each country's financial system. In this sense, a reward system using tokens is the right choice.</li> <li>The design of the token economy is interesting. Instead of giving out tokens right away, it first gives out Grass Points and then settles and gives out tokens at the end of an Epoch. This two-step process has great advantages. First, users don't know how many tokens they will receive with their points, so it's hard to calculate the exact value of the reward, so they can postpone deciding if the reward is appropriate. And by allocating a certain amount of tokens per epoch, the demand for tokens can be fixed even if the number of participating nodes fluctuates. Also, points can be recorded off-chain, so you don't have to pay on-chain fees.</li> <li>The referral program and tier structure is a great example of gamification done right. It's a multi-tiered reward structure. They have different tiers of rewards based on referrals and the amount of points you earn, which encourages you to participate more.</li> <li>It uses blockchain as a trust engine to record proof that the crawl was performed error-free. This is exactly the kind of design that plays to the strengths of blockchain. ZK technology is used to ensure privacy, batch processing is adopted for cost efficiency, and the provenance of the data is recorded on the blockchain so that AI model developers can verify the source of the training data, which increases the trustworthiness of the data. In the future, we expect to see more similar uses of blockchain for data provenance and usage history.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#limitations-open-questions","title":"\u26a0 Limitations / Open Questions","text":"<ul> <li>There is no mention or evidence that Validators and Routers are yet decentralized. Although they are decentralized in terms of using people's idle network resources, the operating systems (Validator and Router) seem to be still centralized.</li> <li>In order to eliminate the operating entity, the Validator and Router must eventually be decentralized, and the ZK Processor and Data Ledger must also be decentralized. With so many decentralization points, it's hard to see how you can decentralize everything. Especially in the case of Data Ledger, it is a very difficult issue because if the amount of data stored is large, it becomes the same as decentralized storage. It remains to be seen in what direction they will decentralize in the future.</li> <li>Node Reputation Scoring is an important factor because nodes can be operated maliciously to maximize rewards. However, the documentation only states the policy to evaluate the reputation of a node, but not how to measure it. For example, it is unclear how the completeness of the response data will be measured. This is the most difficult part of crowdsourcing data collection. There needs to be some way to verify that malicious nodes are not tampering with the data or responding with fake data.</li> <li>Paying points is a clever policy to avoid tying the reward to a cash value, but the fact that the reward can fluctuate depending on the epoch is a pain point for users. If an Epoch ends and the tokens you're rewarded with don't meet your expectations, you may decide to stop participating. Also, since the price of tokens fluctuates, even if you receive the same amount of tokens, if the price of tokens drops, the real value of the tokens drops as well, and there is less incentive to stay engaged.</li> <li>One idea is to handle some scientific calculations or web crawls for public purposes alongside commercial web crawls, so that users can get the satisfaction of knowing that their resources are also contributing to a public cause.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#9-reflections-discussion","title":"9.

Rewarding contributions with tokens is also an appropriate choice. The use of blockchain to issue and distribute tokens is understandable, but the use of blockchain to prove the integrity of web crawling and prove data provenance is less convincing. Blockchain doesn't solve the problem of how to trust an off-chain verification when the verification itself is done off-chain and only the resulting proof is recorded on the blockchain. It is the role of the blockchain to ensure that the proof is not tampered with.</li> <li>At this stage, the level of decentralization is not high, which is why blockchain is being used in a limited way. If this part can be more advanced and made into a protocol for data collection, processing, and distribution, it will have a great impact.</li> <li>It may not be sensitive to the value of the reward because it is monetized by using idle bandwidth, but it can still be affected by the price of the Grass token.

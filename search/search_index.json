Once you've finished writing the Korean report, convert it to English with a translation service like DeepL to create the md file.</p> <p>Don't follow the order of the report template. Save the summary for last. As you research a project and come across something relevant, write it down in the report file immediately. Don't think about writing it down later.</p> <p>When researching a project, prioritize whitepapers and docs. The website and other documents may have a lot of marketing rhetoric.</p> <p>The most up-to-date information is on X, Discord, or Telegram. Don't just look at the website or articles, get into the project community - you'll know exactly what they're working on.</p> <p>The best way to understand a project is to try it out: install an app or use a service or SDK. It doesn't have to be perfect, and if you fail along the way, just document the process. What the project says it does may not be what it actually does.</p> <p>To analyze the token economy, check out Coinmarketcap and Icodrops for the current status of tokens and TGE/Funding. The key to a token economy is to balance the supply/demand of the token. Pay attention to the token's circulating supply, issuance plans, inflation, etc. </p> <p>Most projects publish their Github. Take a look at the repo structure on Github to see how active it is and how many contributors there are. Research the contract address and check it out with block explorer. Dig into the smart contract code and look at the transactions. Search for the project in Dune and analyze the blockchain data.</p> <p>Do research on industries related to your project with AI, it's optimized for this kind of work. ChatGPT's results table is in markdown format, so you can copy and paste it into your report. Make AI work for you.</p> <p>The most important thing is to analyze why it needs to be blockchain. Often, blockchain is used artificially to issue tokens when it's not needed. Critique aggressively why blockchain is needed.</p> <p>At the end, write a lot of comments about the project, even if they are rudimentary. Don't filter your ideas through yourself. Even the most trivial idea can be an insight for someone else.</p> <p>It's not important to write the report itself, that's what ChatGTP does well. What's important is your ability to understand and criticize the project. Writing a report is a formal assignment. I want you to understand, think, and criticize along the way.</p>"},{"location":"course/report_guide/#_1","title":"\ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc791\uc131 \uc870\uc5b8","text":"<p>\uc601\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc790\uc2e0\uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud55c\uae00\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc138\uc694. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c _kr.md \ud30c\uc77c\ub3c4 \uacf5\uc720\ub4dc\ub9b0\uac70\uc5d0\uc694. \ud55c\uae00 \ub9ac\ud3ec\ud2b8 \uc791\uc131\uc774 \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac\ub418\uba74 DeepL \uac19\uc740 \ubc88\uc5ed \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud574\uc11c md \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\uc138\uc694. </p> <p>\ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\ub300\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\uc694.

Even if you don't know the exact markdown syntax, you can easily write documents. However, we recommend that you take this opportunity to familiarize yourself with markdown syntax. The output of many AI services is in markdown format.</p> <ul> <li>Markdown Syntax</li> <li>HackMD Tutorial</li> </ul> <p>HackMD has the ability to collaborate on markdown documents and sync them to Github. For each case study project, I will share two markdown documents, both of which have a report template applied. If it's a Grass project, I'll share the following two files.</p> <ul> <li>grass.md (English version of the report, by default)</li> <li>grass_kr.md (Korean version of the report, optional)</li> </ul> <p>Only the student working on the project will be emailed a link to access the MD file. Clicking the link will open the HackMD editing window, but you won't be able to edit it unless you're signed up for HackMD. Please sign up for HackMD with the email you shared, and you'll have editing permissions and be able to create the document.</p> <p>The instructor will have read/write access to all documents, so they'll know in real time what you're working on, and he can synchronize with the class website Github to update it when needed. You'll then be able to see the results of your work on the class website.</p> <p>The samples of the Grass documentation is shaed as a reference for everyone to see. Open the link below to see the markdown document that the Grass report was created from. You will be able to view the editing screen, but cannot edit it. The documents have utilized most of the markdown syntax, so feel free to copy &amp; paste what you need.</p> <ul> <li>sample_grass.md</li> <li>sample_grass_en.md</li> </ul> <p>There are a few things to keep in mind when writing markdown documents on HackMD. When your document is rendered on the web, a makrdown parser called MkDocs will read your document. So you need to write it in a form that MkDocs can recognize. It is slightly different from the syntax that HackMD understands. Just be careful with the following parts (this is where the HackMD tutorial differs a bit from the one below).</p> <ul> <li>If you want to add images and resize them, you'll need to use HTML syntax.<ul> <li><code>&lt;img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1cF34ZBlg.png\" alt=\"Grass\" width=\"50%\"&gt;</code></li> <li>If you don't need to resize the image, you can follow the HackMD tutorial.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To create a sublist in Ordered/Unordered Lists, you need to put exactly 4 spaces (or 1 tab).<ul> <li>This is so the webpage will represent them correctly.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In Ordered Lists, the lists should be numbered 1,2,3, etc.</li> </ul> <p>HackMD expires sessions frequently, which is annoying. Whenever it happens, you have to do CAPTCHA. If you feel like HackMD isn't doing well, refresh your browser and do CAPTCHA.</p>"},{"location":"course/report_markdown/#_1","title":"\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ud30c\ud2b8","text":"<p>HackMD\ub294 markdown \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \uc791\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\ubc95\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubab0\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc27d\uac8c \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ubc88 \uae30\ud68c\uc5d0 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc775\uc219\ud574 \uc9c0\ub294\uac78 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ud615\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. </p> <ul> <li>Markdown Syntax</li> <li>HackMD Tutorial</li> </ul> <p>HackMD\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc791\uc5c5\ud558\uace0 Github\uc73c\ub85c Sync\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 case study \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ubcc4\ub85c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud574 \ub4dc\ub9b4 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c \ubaa8\ub450 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9cc\uc57d Grass \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub77c\uba74 \uc544\ub798 \ub450\uac1c\uc758 \ud30c\uc77c\uc774 \uacf5\uc720\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p> <ul> <li>grass.md (\uc601\uc5b4 \ubc84\uc804\uc758 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c, \ub514\ud3f4\ud2b8)</li> <li>grass_kr.md (\ud55c\uae00 \ubc84\uc804\uc758 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c, \uc635\uc158)</li> </ul> <p>\ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\ub9cc \ud574\ub2f9 md \ud30c\uc77c \uc811\uc18d \ub9c1\ud06c\uac00 \uba54\uc77c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ud074\ub9ad\ud558\uba74 HackMD \ud3b8\uc9d1\ucc3d\uc774 \uc5f4\ub9ac\ub294\ub370 HackMD\uc5d0 \uac00\uc785\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc774 \uc548\ub420 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uc720\ubc1b\uc740 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\ub85c HackMD\ub97c \uac00\uc785\ud574 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694. \uadf8\ub7ec\uba74 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \uc0dd\uae30\uace0 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p> <p>\uad50\uc218\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 Read/Write \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc11c \uc791\uc131 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c \uc218\uc5c5 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 Github\uacfc \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ud574\uc11c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\uba74 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc740 \uc218\uc5c5 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. </p> <p>\ub808\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud55c Grass \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub798 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc5f4\uba74 Grass \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uac00 \uc791\uc131\ub41c \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3b8\uc9d1\ud654\uba74\uc744 \ubcfc \uc218\ub294 \uc788\ub294\ub9cc \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc740 \uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc791\uc131\ud588\uc73c\ub2c8 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ubcf5\uc0ac&amp;\ubd99\uc5ec\ub123\uae30 \ud558\uc138\uc694.</p> <ul> <li>sample_grass.md</li> <li>sample_grass_kr.md</li> </ul> <p>HackMD\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc2e4 \ub54c \uc720\uc758\ud560 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 Github\uc5d0\uc11c MkDocs\ub77c\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ud30c\uc11c\uac00 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc77d\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 MkDocs\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub798 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc2ec\ud574 \uc8fc\uc2dc\uba74 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In traditional AI applications, agents (such as advanced chatbots or automation scripts) have limited ability to transact value or interact with decentralized systems. AgentKit addresses this by giving every AI agent its own crypto wallet and a suite of onchain actions, allowing agents to hold and transfer assets, deploy smart contracts, and autonomously interact with decentralized apps.</p> <p>By leveraging blockchain, these AI agents become first-class economic actors. They can operate 24/7, make decisions, and directly execute financial transactions without human intermediaries. In practice, AgentKit offers a model-agnostic and framework-agnostic infrastructure: developers can plug in their choice of Large Language Model (LLM), such as OpenAI or others, and connect it to blockchain functionality through Coinbase\u2019s secure APIs.</p> <p>The toolkit includes secure wallet management (based on Coinbase\u2019s Smart Wallet API) and a library of pre-built actions, including token transfers, swaps, contract deployment, and social media operations. This significantly reduces the complexity of building onchain AI agents, as tasks like funding an agent\u2019s wallet, paying gas fees, or calling DeFi protocols are abstracted away by the framework.</p> <p>AgentKit\u2019s key achievements include seamless integration with popular AI frameworks like LangChain, support for multiple blockchains (including EVM-compatible networks and Solana), and an extensible design that allows developers to add custom actions or integrate alternative wallet providers. In short, AgentKit empowers developers to easily create AI-driven applications with built-in crypto capabilities, unlocking new possibilities for automated trading, asset management, decentralized commerce, and more.</p>"},{"location":"reports/coinbase_agentkit/#2-background-problem-statement","title":"2.

Insights &amp; Limitations","text":""},{"location":"reports/grass/#key-takeaways","title":"\u2705 Key Takeaways","text":"<ul> <li>A clever solution to the problem of IP blocking in web crawling by crowdsourcing the devices of ordinary users.</li> <li>Crowdsourcing idle device resources is an old idea. Projects like SETI@Home and Folding@Home have utilized idle resources, and software like BOINC is often used. These projects are called Volunteer Computing because people participate voluntarily without compensation. Grass, on the other hand, is used for the commercial purpose of web crawling and incentivizes participation by rewarding participants with Grass tokens.</li> <li>For crowdsourcing, where nodes are scattered around the world, tokens are the most appropriate way to reward them. Traditional fiat money transfers would be nearly impossible to implement. It is difficult to implement because you need to verify the customer and adapt to each country's financial system. In this sense, a reward system using tokens is the right choice.</li> <li>The design of the token economy is interesting. Instead of giving out tokens right away, it first gives out Grass Points and then settles and gives out tokens at the end of an Epoch. This two-step process has great advantages. First, users don't know how many tokens they will receive with their points, so it's hard to calculate the exact value of the reward, so they can postpone deciding if the reward is appropriate. And by allocating a certain amount of tokens per epoch, the demand for tokens can be fixed even if the number of participating nodes fluctuates. Also, points can be recorded off-chain, so you don't have to pay on-chain fees.</li> <li>The referral program and tier structure is a great example of gamification done right. It's a multi-tiered reward structure. They have different tiers of rewards based on referrals and the amount of points you earn, which encourages you to participate more.</li> <li>It uses blockchain as a trust engine to record proof that the crawl was performed error-free. This is exactly the kind of design that plays to the strengths of blockchain. ZK technology is used to ensure privacy, batch processing is adopted for cost efficiency, and the provenance of the data is recorded on the blockchain so that AI model developers can verify the source of the training data, which increases the trustworthiness of the data. In the future, we expect to see more similar uses of blockchain for data provenance and usage history.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#limitations-open-questions","title":"\u26a0 Limitations / Open Questions","text":"<ul> <li>There is no mention or evidence that Validators and Routers are yet decentralized. Although they are decentralized in terms of using people's idle network resources, the operating systems (Validator and Router) seem to be still centralized.</li> <li>In order to eliminate the operating entity, the Validator and Router must eventually be decentralized, and the ZK Processor and Data Ledger must also be decentralized. With so many decentralization points, it's hard to see how you can decentralize everything. Especially in the case of Data Ledger, it is a very difficult issue because if the amount of data stored is large, it becomes the same as decentralized storage. It remains to be seen in what direction they will decentralize in the future.</li> <li>Node Reputation Scoring is an important factor because nodes can be operated maliciously to maximize rewards. However, the documentation only states the policy to evaluate the reputation of a node, but not how to measure it. For example, it is unclear how the completeness of the response data will be measured. This is the most difficult part of crowdsourcing data collection. There needs to be some way to verify that malicious nodes are not tampering with the data or responding with fake data.</li> <li>Paying points is a clever policy to avoid tying the reward to a cash value, but the fact that the reward can fluctuate depending on the epoch is a pain point for users. If an Epoch ends and the tokens you're rewarded with don't meet your expectations, you may decide to stop participating. Also, since the price of tokens fluctuates, even if you receive the same amount of tokens, if the price of tokens drops, the real value of the tokens drops as well, and there is less incentive to stay engaged.</li> <li>One idea is to handle some scientific calculations or web crawls for public purposes alongside commercial web crawls, so that users can get the satisfaction of knowing that their resources are also contributing to a public cause.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#9-reflections-discussion","title":"9.

In particular, blockchain is a trust engine that can solve many of AI's problems. We divided the areas where the two technologies can synergize into five categories and selected around six projects from each category. Students will each choose one project, research and analyze it, and publish a markdown report on this site.</p>"},{"location":"#week-3-crypto-sdk-chain-support-for-ai","title":"\ud83d\udd27 Week 3 \u2013 Crypto SDK &amp; Chain support for AI","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) GOAT SDK \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Coinbase AgentKit \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Solana Agent Kit \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 GOAT Gaming \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-4-decentralized-ai-infrastructure-modeldata-gpu-sharing","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Week 4 \u2013 Decentralized AI infrastructure (model/data, GPU sharing)","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) Sahara AI \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Grass ($GRASS) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Bittensor ($TAO) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 NATIX ($NATIX) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Render Network ($RENDER) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Yupp \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 AIOZ ($AIOZ) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-5-stablecoins-payment-rails-for-ai-agents","title":"\ud83d\udcb8 Week 5 \u2013 Stablecoins &amp; Payment rails for AI agents","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) Halliday \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Nevermined \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Agent Commerce Kit (ACK) by Catena \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Skyfire \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 0xSplits \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Coinbase x402 \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-6-proof-of-personhood-identity-rails-for-ai","title":"\ud83d\udec2 Week 6 \u2013 Proof of personhood &amp; identity rails for AI","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) World ID \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Solana Attestation Service \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Human Passport \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Humanity Protocol \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 BrightID \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Civic \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-7-ai-agent-co-ownership-and-decentralized-ai","title":"\ud83e\udd16 Week 7 \u2013 AI agent co-ownership and Decentralized AI","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 ElizaOS \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Kaito \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 OLAS \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 ASI Alliance \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Phala Network \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 NANDA: The Internet of AI Agents \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>about</p>"},{"location":"course/","title":"Course","text":"<p>course</p>"},{"location":"project/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>project</p>"},{"location":"report/","title":"Report","text":"<p>report</p>"},{"location":"test/","title":"Test","text":"<p>This is the first doc. * test1 * test2 * \ud55c\uae00\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5</p> <p>\uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud568 This is the test + \uc218\uc815\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud574\ubcfc\uae4c~</p> <p>Gari Test =&gt; 2\ucc28 \uc218\uc815</p> Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Text Text Text <p></p>      \ud83d\udc4d \uc774 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\uac00 \uc720\uc775\ud588\uc5b4\uc694         \ud83d\udc4e \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574\uc694"},{"location":"reports/","title":"Overview","text":""},{"location":"reports/coinbase_agentkit/","title":"Coinbase AgentKit","text":""},{"location":"reports/goat/","title":"GOAT SDK","text":""},{"location":"reports/goat_gaming/","title":"GOAT Gaming","text":""},{"location":"reports/grass/","title":"Grass","text":""},{"location":"reports/saharaai/","title":"Sahara AI","text":""},{"location":"reports/solana_agentkit/","title":"Solana Agent Kit","text":""},{"location":"reports/template/","title":"Template for reports","text":"<p>All reports should start with the template below.

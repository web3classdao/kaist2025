Once you've finished writing the Korean report, convert it to English with a translation service like DeepL to create the md file.</p> <p>Don't follow the order of the report template. Save the summary for last. As you research a project and come across something relevant, write it down in the report file immediately. Don't think about writing it down later.</p> <p>When researching a project, prioritize whitepapers and docs. The website and other documents may have a lot of marketing rhetoric.</p> <p>The most up-to-date information is on X, Discord, or Telegram. Don't just look at the website or articles, get into the project community - you'll know exactly what they're working on.</p> <p>The best way to understand a project is to try it out: install an app or use a service or SDK. It doesn't have to be perfect, and if you fail along the way, just document the process. What the project says it does may not be what it actually does.</p> <p>To analyze the token economy, check out Coinmarketcap and Icodrops for the current status of tokens and TGE/Funding. The key to a token economy is to balance the supply/demand of the token. Pay attention to the token's circulating supply, issuance plans, inflation, etc. </p> <p>Most projects publish their Github. Take a look at the repo structure on Github to see how active it is and how many contributors there are. Research the contract address and check it out with block explorer. Dig into the smart contract code and look at the transactions. Search for the project in Dune and analyze the blockchain data.</p> <p>Do research on industries related to your project with AI, it's optimized for this kind of work. ChatGPT's results table is in markdown format, so you can copy and paste it into your report. Make AI work for you.</p> <p>The most important thing is to analyze why it needs to be blockchain. Often, blockchain is used artificially to issue tokens when it's not needed. Critique aggressively why blockchain is needed.</p> <p>At the end, write a lot of comments about the project, even if they are rudimentary. Don't filter your ideas through yourself. Even the most trivial idea can be an insight for someone else.</p> <p>It's not important to write the report itself, that's what ChatGTP does well. What's important is your ability to understand and criticize the project. Writing a report is a formal assignment. I want you to understand, think, and criticize along the way.</p>"},{"location":"course/report_guide/#_1","title":"\ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc791\uc131 \uc870\uc5b8","text":"<p>\uc601\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc790\uc2e0\uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud55c\uae00\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc138\uc694. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c _kr.md \ud30c\uc77c\ub3c4 \uacf5\uc720\ub4dc\ub9b0\uac70\uc5d0\uc694. \ud55c\uae00 \ub9ac\ud3ec\ud2b8 \uc791\uc131\uc774 \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac\ub418\uba74 DeepL \uac19\uc740 \ubc88\uc5ed \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud574\uc11c md \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\uc138\uc694. </p> <p>\ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\ub300\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\uc694.

Even if you don't know the exact markdown syntax, you can easily write documents. However, we recommend that you take this opportunity to familiarize yourself with markdown syntax. The output of many AI services is in markdown format.</p> <ul> <li>Markdown Syntax</li> <li>HackMD Tutorial</li> </ul> <p>HackMD has the ability to collaborate on markdown documents and sync them to Github. For each case study project, I will share two markdown documents, both of which have a report template applied. If it's a Grass project, I'll share the following two files.</p> <ul> <li>grass.md (English version of the report, by default)</li> <li>grass_kr.md (Korean version of the report, optional)</li> </ul> <p>Only the student working on the project will be emailed a link to access the MD file. Clicking the link will open the HackMD editing window, but you won't be able to edit it unless you're signed up for HackMD. Please sign up for HackMD with the email you shared, and you'll have editing permissions and be able to create the document.</p> <p>The instructor will have read/write access to all documents, so they'll know in real time what you're working on, and he can synchronize with the class website Github to update it when needed. You'll then be able to see the results of your work on the class website.</p> <p>The samples of the Grass documentation is shaed as a reference for everyone to see. Open the link below to see the markdown document that the Grass report was created from. You will be able to view the editing screen, but cannot edit it. The documents have utilized most of the markdown syntax, so feel free to copy &amp; paste what you need.</p> <ul> <li>sample_grass.md</li> <li>sample_grass_en.md</li> </ul> <p>There are a few things to keep in mind when writing markdown documents on HackMD. When your document is rendered on the web, a makrdown parser called MkDocs will read your document. So you need to write it in a form that MkDocs can recognize. It is slightly different from the syntax that HackMD understands. Just be careful with the following parts (this is where the HackMD tutorial differs a bit from the one below).</p> <ul> <li>If you want to add images and resize them, you'll need to use HTML syntax.<ul> <li><code>&lt;img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1cF34ZBlg.png\" alt=\"Grass\" width=\"50%\"&gt;</code></li> <li>If you don't need to resize the image, you can follow the HackMD tutorial.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To create a sublist in Ordered/Unordered Lists, you need to put exactly 4 spaces (or 1 tab).<ul> <li>This is so the webpage will represent them correctly.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In Ordered Lists, the lists should be numbered 1,2,3, etc.</li> </ul> <p>HackMD expires sessions frequently, which is annoying. Whenever it happens, you have to do CAPTCHA. If you feel like HackMD isn't doing well, refresh your browser and do CAPTCHA.</p>"},{"location":"course/report_markdown/#_1","title":"\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ud30c\ud2b8","text":"<p>HackMD\ub294 markdown \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \uc791\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\ubc95\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubab0\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc27d\uac8c \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ubc88 \uae30\ud68c\uc5d0 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc775\uc219\ud574 \uc9c0\ub294\uac78 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ud615\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. </p> <ul> <li>Markdown Syntax</li> <li>HackMD Tutorial</li> </ul> <p>HackMD\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc791\uc5c5\ud558\uace0 Github\uc73c\ub85c Sync\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 case study \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ubcc4\ub85c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud574 \ub4dc\ub9b4 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c \ubaa8\ub450 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9cc\uc57d Grass \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub77c\uba74 \uc544\ub798 \ub450\uac1c\uc758 \ud30c\uc77c\uc774 \uacf5\uc720\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p> <ul> <li>grass.md (\uc601\uc5b4 \ubc84\uc804\uc758 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c, \ub514\ud3f4\ud2b8)</li> <li>grass_kr.md (\ud55c\uae00 \ubc84\uc804\uc758 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c, \uc635\uc158)</li> </ul> <p>\ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\ub9cc \ud574\ub2f9 md \ud30c\uc77c \uc811\uc18d \ub9c1\ud06c\uac00 \uba54\uc77c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ud074\ub9ad\ud558\uba74 HackMD \ud3b8\uc9d1\ucc3d\uc774 \uc5f4\ub9ac\ub294\ub370 HackMD\uc5d0 \uac00\uc785\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc774 \uc548\ub420 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uc720\ubc1b\uc740 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\ub85c HackMD\ub97c \uac00\uc785\ud574 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694. \uadf8\ub7ec\uba74 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \uc0dd\uae30\uace0 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p> <p>\uad50\uc218\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 Read/Write \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc11c \uc791\uc131 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c \uc218\uc5c5 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 Github\uacfc \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ud574\uc11c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\uba74 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc740 \uc218\uc5c5 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. </p> <p>\ub808\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud55c Grass \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub798 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc5f4\uba74 Grass \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uac00 \uc791\uc131\ub41c \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3b8\uc9d1\ud654\uba74\uc744 \ubcfc \uc218\ub294 \uc788\ub294\ub9cc \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc740 \uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc791\uc131\ud588\uc73c\ub2c8 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ubcf5\uc0ac&amp;\ubd99\uc5ec\ub123\uae30 \ud558\uc138\uc694.</p> <ul> <li>sample_grass.md</li> <li>sample_grass_kr.md</li> </ul> <p>HackMD\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc2e4 \ub54c \uc720\uc758\ud560 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 Github\uc5d0\uc11c MkDocs\ub77c\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ud30c\uc11c\uac00 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc77d\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 MkDocs\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub798 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc2ec\ud574 \uc8fc\uc2dc\uba74 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This year, I was particularly worried about what to teach. With the recent rapid development of AI, you can learn knowledge anywhere, and even without knowledge, you can achieve the desired result. I'm seeing more and more people around me who don't come from a computer science background, but are building services with vibe coding. They don't know CS 101, algorithms, or programming languages. But they're creating the results they want, and it's an amazing world.</p> <p>In the AI age, what should I teach undergraduate computer science students? To be honest, I don't really know the answer. I could just go back to teaching Blockchain 101 and teach solidity programming. However, I kept asking myself what the point of that would be, so I came up with Sense of Knowledge. It's not teaching the knowledge itself, it's teaching the sense of how and when to utilize the knowledge. In short, it's teaching how to ask questions. It's directing AI how to do things.</p> <p>However, teaching the sense of using knowledge is not easy. You can't learn it by learning grammar and looking at examples like learning a programming language. You can only learn it by experiencing it. So in this class, I minimized the lecture part and focused on letting you experience it yourself. I know it's not easy to do an AI x Blockchain case study after just two weeks of a basic class, but it's not impossible because we have AI tools now, and I'm sure many of you have had a lot of help from AI, so writing a report is not hard anymore. The hard part is understanding the content and giving the right instructions to the AI to get to the point. I tried to convey in class what questions you should ask, and I also guided you through the report template, so I hope that was conveyed well.</p> <p>Knowledge has become cheap, so what you know is not a great competitive advantage. So what is? I think it's execution. There's a lot of great AI tools out there. If you don't know something, you can ask an AI, and it'll give you an answer in no time. Many people don't know anything about painting, but they can create a piece of digital art in less than 10 minutes. We've all created images with AI out of curiosity, but how many of you have ever submitted them to a digital art competition? That's a different question. AI can't just do it for you, you have to do it yourself. It's execution. Thanks to AI, you can come up with a new concept in 10 minutes. But applying to a hackathon or a grant program is a different story. Now that everyone has an AI weapon, it's the people who can use it to create results that will differentiate themselves. To do that, they shouldn't just learn for the sake of learning, they should learn to create results, and that's what I hope the hackathon and grant program will do.</p> <p>We published the reports and projects in real time on the web, so everyone can see them. To do this, I organized Github, mkdocs, HackMD, etc. to create a real-time publishing service. I could just get the reports and projects in a Google Drive folder. But I made it complicated for a reason. Your deliverables are now your history, you're documenting the journey of this class, you're documenting a line on your resume that you can use in the future. Someone might be inspired by your report or reach out to you. In the future, it's going to be more about the process than the result itself, so keep track of your journey, it's going to be your story, it's going to be your narrative.</p> <p>This class has given you one more weapon in your arsenal: blockchain. Of course, if you don't know what it is, you can ask an AI. However, it's probably not as easy to understand and experience as many of you have presented and learned in class. The marriage of AI and blockchain is still in its infancy. The two technologies complement each other, so there will definitely be opportunities at the intersection of the two. Don't end your blockchain journey here, but stay interested and learn more.</p> <p>I'm happy to have connected with many of you through the course. I'm a person who values relationships, so if you have any questions or need advice, please don't hesitate to reach out to me - you can reach me via email. I hope this class has been helpful to you in your academic journey.</p>"},{"location":"course/wrapup/#_1","title":"\uc218\uac15\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub294 \ud3b8\uc9c0","text":"<p>8\uc8fc\uac04\uc758 \uc9e7\uc740 \uacfc\uc815\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\ub984\ud559\uae30 \uce58\uace0\ub294 \ub098\ub984 \ube61\uc13c \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc798 \ub530\ub77c\uc640 \uc8fc\uc2e0 \ud559\uc0dd \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uaed8 \uac10\uc0ac\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. </p> <p>2023\ub144\ubd80\ud130 KAIST\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6f93\uc640 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uac15\uc758\ub97c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \ub9e4\ub144 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ubc14\uafb8\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc62c\ud574\ub294 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uccd0\uc57c \ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud2b9\ud788 \uace0\ubbfc\uc774 \ub9ce\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc AI\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub514\uc11c\ub098 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\ub529\uc774 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uace0 \uc788\uc8e0. \uc81c \uc8fc\ubcc0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc804\uc0b0\ud559 \ucd9c\uc2e0\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc14\uc774\ube0c \ucf54\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7f0\uc800\ub7f0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \ub298\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 CS 101\uc774\ub098 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 1\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\uc8e0. \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc138\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. </p> <p>\uc774\ub7f0 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uacfc\uc5f0 \uc804\uc0b0\ud559\uacfc \ud559\ubd80\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uccd0\uc57c \ub420\uae4c? \uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \uc800\ub3c4 \ub2f5\uc744 \uc798 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc608\uc804\ucc98\ub7fc \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 101 \uac15\uc758\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc194\ub9ac\ub514\ud2f0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce60 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\uac8c \ubb34\uc2a8 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub04a\uc784\uc5c6\uc774 \ubc18\ubb38\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub354\uad70\uc694. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \uc0dd\uac01\ud574 \ub0b8 \uac83\uc774 Sense of Knowledge \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294\uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uac10\uac01\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294\uac70\uc8e0. \ud55c\ub9c8\ub514\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Elimination of Intermediaries: No central authority can freeze accounts, change terms, or extract fees. Users maintain full control of their financial relationships. This also profits by allowing users to send money regardless of the time - for traditional bank accounts, it is impossible to send money near midnight.</p> <p>3.

Diary Writing &amp; Privacy Protection: When a user writes a diary entry, the original text is never stored; only its SHA-256 hash and timestamp are saved, minimizing the risk of personal data leakage. 2. AI-Powered Mood Analysis: Firebase Functions call the OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini) to return up to three emotion tags and their scores in JSON format, with a keyword-matching local analysis as a fallback if the model call fails. 3. Personalized Playlist Generation: For each extracted mood tag, the system randomly selects songs from a predefined music catalog, creating a playlist of up to 10 tracks. 4. Digital Card (JSON) Creation: Generates a downloadable JSON file containing mood, playlist, and provenance information. 5. NFT Minting: Mints NFTs via the Phantom wallet on the Solana devnet or mainnet, with the current absence of a metadata program meaning NFTs may not be automatically recognized in some environments. 6.

In the past, a diary app in Korea leaked user data and used personal entries for commercial purposes. In this project, the original text is never stored on a central server.

Why Blockchain","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Overcoming the Limits of Centralized Sybil Defenses   The problem BrightID addresses\u2014individuals creating multiple accounts to receive duplicate rewards\u2014is prone to abuse if verification authority is centralized. BrightID adopts the principle that \"it should not be controlled by a single centralized organization\", making blockchain-based decentralization a core design requirement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Full Replication &amp; Multi-Algorithm Verification   The social graph is fully replicated across all nodes, and blockchain immutably records all changes. This allows independent research teams or communities to run their own anti-Sybil algorithms in parallel and cross-validate results. Even if one analysis model fails, the network as a whole remains secure.</p> </li> <li> <p>IDChain: Immutability &amp; Auditability   All changes to connections are recorded as transactions on IDChain, an Ethereum-based Proof-of-Authority blockchain. This enables anyone to trace and audit the origin and timestamp of verification results, eliminating the risk of tampering or forgery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Privacy-Preserving Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)   Users sign connections with their private keys and retain ownership of their data. The blockchain stores only minimal metadata (e.g., hashes, connection events), while personal information (e.g., real names, photos) is exchanged off-chain via P2P\u2014ensuring GDPR-level privacy protection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Public Goods Governance &amp; Transparent Funding   The 1 DAI sponsorship fee flows into a DAO treasury (smart contract) and is transparently allocated.

In traditional AI applications, agents (such as advanced chatbots or automation scripts) have limited ability to transact value or interact with decentralized systems. AgentKit addresses this by giving every AI agent its own crypto wallet and a suite of onchain actions, allowing agents to hold and transfer assets, deploy smart contracts, and autonomously interact with decentralized apps.</p> <p>By leveraging blockchain, these AI agents become first-class economic actors. They can operate 24/7, make decisions, and directly execute financial transactions without human intermediaries. In practice, AgentKit offers a model-agnostic and framework-agnostic infrastructure: developers can plug in their choice of Large Language Model (LLM), such as OpenAI or others, and connect it to blockchain functionality through Coinbase\u2019s secure APIs.</p> <p>The toolkit includes secure wallet management (based on Coinbase\u2019s Smart Wallet API) and a library of pre-built actions, including token transfers, swaps, contract deployment, and social media operations. This significantly reduces the complexity of building onchain AI agents, as tasks like funding an agent\u2019s wallet, paying gas fees, or calling DeFi protocols are abstracted away by the framework.</p> <p>AgentKit\u2019s key achievements include seamless integration with popular AI frameworks like LangChain, support for multiple blockchains (including EVM-compatible networks and Solana), and an extensible design that allows developers to add custom actions or integrate alternative wallet providers. In short, AgentKit empowers developers to easily create AI-driven applications with built-in crypto capabilities, unlocking new possibilities for automated trading, asset management, decentralized commerce, and more.</p>"},{"location":"reports/coinbase_agentkit/#2-background-problem-statement","title":"2.

The goal is to empower AI agents to act as independent participants on the blockchain. By giving them a wallet and a set of blockchain tools, AgentKit allows an AI to autonomously execute tasks like sending payments, interacting with smart contracts, and swapping tokens based on natural language commands.</p> <p>How It Works</p> <p>AgentKit acts as a bridge between AI and blockchain technology.</p> <ul> <li>For the Blockchain: It leverages the Coinbase Developer Platform to handle complex operations like transaction signing and fee management, simplifying the development process.</li> <li>For the AI: It is designed to be \"model-agnostic,\" meaning it works with various AI models and popular development frameworks like LangChain. When an AI decides to perform a financial action, AgentKit translates that intent into a secure onchain transaction.</li> </ul> <p>Key Differentiators</p> <p>AgentKit stands out due to its flexibility and unique focus:</p> <ul> <li>Framework Agnostic: Unlike more rigid solutions, it supports multiple large language models (like those from OpenAI and Anthropic), various blockchains (including all EVM networks and Solana), and is not tied to a single wallet provider.</li> <li>Developer-Focused: It is built for ease of use, featuring simple configurations and starter templates to significantly lower the barrier for developers to integrate AI with blockchain.</li> <li>Unique Direction: While some projects focus on decentralizing AI itself, AgentKit concentrates on enabling AI to use crypto infrastructure.

Its design allows developers to easily add new capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wallet Provider:     This component handles all wallet-related functions, including address creation, key management, and transaction signing. By default, it uses Coinbase\u2019s Smart Wallet, which enables advanced features like gasless transactions. A key feature is its flexibility; developers can replace the default with other providers, such as MetaMask or hardware wallets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Action Providers:     Actions are the specific skills available to the AI. These are grouped into \"Providers,\" such as a \"DeFi Provider\" for swapping tokens or a \"Social Provider\" for posting to Twitter.

Initialization and Setup</p> <p>First, a developer configures the AI agent by providing necessary API keys (e.g., for Coinbase and OpenAI). Using AgentKit, the developer instantiates the agent, which automatically provisions a unique crypto wallet. At this point, the AI agent is live and equipped with a set of onchain abilities, such as transferring funds or interacting with smart contracts.</p> <p>2. User Command</p> <p>A user interacts with the agent using plain English through a chat interface. For example, they might ask, \"Send 0.01 ETH to my friend,\" or \"Create a new collectible token.\" The user does not need any technical knowledge of blockchain operations.</p> <p>3. AI Planning and Action Selection</p> <p>The AI agent, powered by a large language model (LLM), interprets the user's request. It consults the list of available \"Actions\" provided by AgentKit and identifies the correct tool for the job (e.g., the <code>transfer</code> action). The agent then structures the request with the necessary parameters, such as the asset, amount, and recipient address.</p> <p>4. Onchain Execution</p> <p>The agent invokes the selected action through AgentKit. This is where AgentKit handles all the technical complexity. It automatically creates the transaction, signs it with the agent's private key, and broadcasts it to the appropriate blockchain network. This entire process occurs securely in the background without requiring user intervention.</p> <p>5. Confirmation and Response</p> <p>Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, AgentKit reports the outcome back to the AI agent. The agent then provides a clear, user-friendly confirmation, often including a transaction hash or a link to a block explorer for verification. From the user's perspective, they simply made a request and received a confirmation that it was completed.</p> <p>Optional: Autonomous Operation</p> <p>Beyond direct commands, agents can be programmed to operate autonomously. For instance, an agent could be assigned a goal like \"monitor the market and execute trades to maximize profit.\" In this mode, the agent would independently decide when to execute transactions, using AgentKit to perform the onchain actions in a continuous loop.</p>"},{"location":"reports/coinbase_agentkit/#4-token-economy-if-applicable","title":"4.

Why Blockchain","text":"<p>Blockchain technology is a fundamental component for unlocking the full potential of AI agents by providing them with true financial autonomy. It allows an agent to hold and transfer value directly through a crypto wallet, eliminating the need for traditional banking intermediaries and their associated restrictions. This creates a trustless and censorship-resistant environment where the AI truly owns its digital assets, can operate 24/7 without waiting for business hours, and can transact globally with anyone. The public and verifiable nature of blockchain also ensures every action the agent takes is transparent and auditable, fostering trust in its operations.</p> <p>Beyond simple payments, blockchain gives AI agents access to a vast and composable ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and financial protocols (DeFi). This enables an AI to do more than just send money; it can lend assets, trade on decentralized exchanges, invest in digital collectibles, or participate in decentralized governance. This integration with the broader Web3 world allows for far more sophisticated and powerful applications than possible in a closed system. Furthermore, the efficiency of modern blockchains, particularly Layer 2 solutions, supports instant, low-cost microtransactions, making it feasible for agents to pay for data, services, or other resources in real-time.</p>"},{"location":"reports/coinbase_agentkit/#8-insights-limitations","title":"8.

Why Blockchain","text":"<ul> <li>Why does this problem specifically require blockchain to be solved well? A. ElizaOS addresses the challenge of enabling AI agents to autonomously interact with decentralized Web3 environments where trust, transparency, and security are paramount. Traditional centralized systems cannot guarantee immutable records nor facilitate permissionless execution across multiple blockchain networks. Blockchain\u2019s decentralized ledger ensures agent activities are verifiable, tamper-proof, and executed without trusted intermediaries. This immutable and trustless environment is essential to prevent fraud, censorship, and unauthorized control over autonomous AI agents.</li> <li>What does blockchain enable that traditional solutions cannot? A. Blockchain provides a programmable, transparent, and decentralized execution layer where AI agents can autonomously perform complex on-chain operations like token swaps, NFT minting, and DeFi interactions. Unlike centralized APIs that act as gatekeepers and single points of failure, blockchain offers composability\u2014allowing seamless integration of multiple protocols\u2014and full auditability of transactions. Combined with cryptographic tools and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), it also enables enhanced privacy and security for sensitive operations, which traditional solutions cannot reliably guarantee.</li> <li>Is decentralization critical in this use case? Why or why not? A. Yes, decentralization is critical for ElizaOS because autonomous AI agents managing valuable assets and executing transactions must operate free from central points of control or failure. Centralized control introduces risks of censorship, manipulation, and single points of vulnerability, undermining user trust and agent autonomy. Decentralization ensures no single entity can revoke, alter, or control agent actions, providing the resilience, fairness, and trustlessness necessary for a robust AI-powered Web3 ecosystem.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/elizaos/#8-insights-limitations","title":"8.

It gained massive popularity in the Philippines. One of the reasons is that many Filipinos lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic and turned to Axie Infinity as an alternative source of income. At its peak, around 40% of Axie Infinity players were Filipino. However, as the value of cryptocurrencies declined, player earnings fell below the minimum wage.

And to verify the source and path of data, it should be transparently recorded on-chain.</p> </li> <li> <p>User Ownership: Users should own their contributions to the internet, otherwise they will continue to be exploited by large tech companies.</p> <p>In a typical big tech company, users don't know about their contributions, can't claim them, and can't be compensated for them. However, your contributions should belong to you. This requires a blockchain-based way to record and control contributions.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#8-insights-limitations","title":"8. Insights &amp; Limitations","text":""},{"location":"reports/grass/#key-takeaways","title":"\u2705 Key Takeaways","text":"<ul> <li>A clever solution to the problem of IP blocking in web crawling by crowdsourcing the devices of ordinary users.</li> <li>Crowdsourcing idle device resources is an old idea. Projects like SETI@Home and Folding@Home have utilized idle resources, and software like BOINC is often used. These projects are called Volunteer Computing because people participate voluntarily without compensation. Grass, on the other hand, is used for the commercial purpose of web crawling and incentivizes participation by rewarding participants with Grass tokens.</li> <li>For crowdsourcing, where nodes are scattered around the world, tokens are the most appropriate way to reward them. Traditional fiat money transfers would be nearly impossible to implement. It is difficult to implement because you need to verify the customer and adapt to each country's financial system. In this sense, a reward system using tokens is the right choice.</li> <li>The design of the token economy is interesting. Instead of giving out tokens right away, it first gives out Grass Points and then settles and gives out tokens at the end of an Epoch. This two-step process has great advantages. First, users don't know how many tokens they will receive with their points, so it's hard to calculate the exact value of the reward, so they can postpone deciding if the reward is appropriate. And by allocating a certain amount of tokens per epoch, the demand for tokens can be fixed even if the number of participating nodes fluctuates. Also, points can be recorded off-chain, so you don't have to pay on-chain fees.</li> <li>The referral program and tier structure is a great example of gamification done right. It's a multi-tiered reward structure. They have different tiers of rewards based on referrals and the amount of points you earn, which encourages you to participate more.</li> <li>It uses blockchain as a trust engine to record proof that the crawl was performed error-free. This is exactly the kind of design that plays to the strengths of blockchain. ZK technology is used to ensure privacy, batch processing is adopted for cost efficiency, and the provenance of the data is recorded on the blockchain so that AI model developers can verify the source of the training data, which increases the trustworthiness of the data. In the future, we expect to see more similar uses of blockchain for data provenance and usage history.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#limitations-open-questions","title":"\u26a0 Limitations / Open Questions","text":"<ul> <li>There is no mention or evidence that Validators and Routers are yet decentralized. Although they are decentralized in terms of using people's idle network resources, the operating systems (Validator and Router) seem to be still centralized.</li> <li>In order to eliminate the operating entity, the Validator and Router must eventually be decentralized, and the ZK Processor and Data Ledger must also be decentralized. With so many decentralization points, it's hard to see how you can decentralize everything. Especially in the case of Data Ledger, it is a very difficult issue because if the amount of data stored is large, it becomes the same as decentralized storage. It remains to be seen in what direction they will decentralize in the future.</li> <li>Node Reputation Scoring is an important factor because nodes can be operated maliciously to maximize rewards. However, the documentation only states the policy to evaluate the reputation of a node, but not how to measure it. For example, it is unclear how the completeness of the response data will be measured. This is the most difficult part of crowdsourcing data collection. There needs to be some way to verify that malicious nodes are not tampering with the data or responding with fake data.</li> <li>Paying points is a clever policy to avoid tying the reward to a cash value, but the fact that the reward can fluctuate depending on the epoch is a pain point for users. If an Epoch ends and the tokens you're rewarded with don't meet your expectations, you may decide to stop participating. Also, since the price of tokens fluctuates, even if you receive the same amount of tokens, if the price of tokens drops, the real value of the tokens drops as well, and there is less incentive to stay engaged.</li> <li>One idea is to handle some scientific calculations or web crawls for public purposes alongside commercial web crawls, so that users can get the satisfaction of knowing that their resources are also contributing to a public cause.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/grass/#9-reflections-discussion","title":"9.

Rewarding contributions with tokens is also an appropriate choice. The use of blockchain to issue and distribute tokens is understandable, but the use of blockchain to prove the integrity of web crawling and prove data provenance is less convincing. Blockchain doesn't solve the problem of how to trust an off-chain verification when the verification itself is done off-chain and only the resulting proof is recorded on the blockchain. It is the role of the blockchain to ensure that the proof is not tampered with.</li> <li>At this stage, the level of decentralization is not high, which is why blockchain is being used in a limited way. If this part can be more advanced and made into a protocol for data collection, processing, and distribution, it will have a great impact.</li> <li>It may not be sensitive to the value of the reward because it is monetized by using idle bandwidth, but it can still be affected by the price of the Grass token.

Crypto data is scattered across Discord, governance forums, social media and on\u2011chain feeds. Traditional search engines struggle to provide reliable crypto intelligence because the data is siloed and unstructured[1]. Kaito Pro addresses this by indexing terabytes of unstructured content from thousands of Web3 sources and turning it into real\u2011time, AI\u2011driven insights[2]. To align incentives, Kaito issues an ERC\u201120 token (KAITO) on Base L2; users pay with KAITO to run analyses, while data providers and model validators earn KAITO for contributing compute or information. The platform raised US10.8\u00a0million** from investors such as Dragonfly Capital and Sequoia Capital China and claims over **250\u202f000 users** with only **25\u202f000** Yap points distributed daily, making participation scarce[[3]](https://www.aicoin.com/en/article/443784#:~:text=distributed%20daily%20is%20only%2025%2C000%2C,increases%20exponentially%2C%20creating%20intense%20competition). Kaito Pro charges enterprise users **US833 per month (billed annually), payable either in USD or KAITO tokens[4]. Its tokenomics allocate 56.67\u00a0% of supply to community and ecosystem initiatives, while the remaining tokens go to contributors, investors and the foundation[5].</p> <p>Key takeaway: Kaito AI blends AI search and blockchain incentives to create an information finance (InfoFi) network, rewarding high\u2011quality data contributors while giving researchers a unified view of fragmented Web3 information.</p>"},{"location":"reports/kaito/#2-background-problem-statement","title":"2. Background &amp; Problem Statement","text":"<p>\u00b7 Real\u2011world problem: The crypto space is flooded with unstructured data scattered across social media, governance forums, podcasts and other platforms. This fragmentation makes it \u201cnearly impossible to keep up with the industry,\u201d preventing investors from finding actionable insights[6]. Search engines like Google are inadequate for crypto because they cannot deliver trusted, context\u2011rich intelligence[7].</p> <p>\u00b7 Limitations of centralized approaches: Centralized analytics platforms own the data pipelines, creating single points of failure. Users cannot verify how data is processed or whether algorithms are biased. Central hubs can censor content or prioritize information unfairly, and content creators receive little compensation. Traditional systems also lack verifiable provenance, so insiders may profit from information asymmetry.</p> <p>\u00b7  Why this matters in AI: The rise of large language models (LLMs) allows AI to derive meaning from unstructured text.

Over three years it has indexed diverse sources and enhanced them with semantic models and analytics[8]. Core features include purpose\u2011built indexing of social media, governance forums, Farcaster, Telegram, Medium and proprietary podcast transcripts[2]; real\u2011time intelligence; MetaSearch across thousands of premium Web3 sources; sentiment analytics; smart alerts and dashboards; and tools like a catalyst calendar and AI copilot[9].</p> </li> <li> <p>Incentive alignment via tokenization: Users pay in KAITO tokens to run queries. Data providers and model validators stake KAITO, contribute data or compute, and earn rewards when they produce correct results. The Yaps system tokenizes attention: users earn \u201cYap points\u201d for publishing high\u2011quality crypto content, with only 25\u202f000 points distributed daily despite having more than 250\u202f000 users[3]. These points can later translate into KAITO airdrops or privileges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verifiable compute and slashing: Validators run AI models and attach zero\u2011knowledge proofs to attest to correct computation.

Background &amp; Problem Statement","text":"<ul> <li> <p>What real-world problem does this project aim to solve?     Phala Network addresses a fundamental issue in modern AI infrastructure: the centralization of computation and data control, and the lack of robust privacy guarantees.     Today\u2019s AI services are primarily operated by a few cloud giants (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), which leads to:</p> <ul> <li>Monopolized control over data and models</li> <li>Privacy risks for user data</li> <li>High costs and lack of transparency</li> <li>Potential censorship or restriction by governments or corporations</li> </ul> <p>As AI becomes critical to more aspects of society, issues such as data ownership, trust in computation, and equitable access to AI services are becoming increasingly important.</p> </li> <li> <p>What are the limitations of existing (centralized) approaches?     Centralized AI infrastructure has structural limitations:</p> <ul> <li>Censorship and control risks: Corporations or governments can unilaterally restrict access to certain models or datasets</li> <li>Data exposure threats: Central servers present high risks of hacking or misuse of personal data</li> <li>Lack of transparency: Users cannot verify how models are run or what data is used</li> <li>Cost barriers and monopolies: Only large companies can afford to operate or use enterprise-level AI infrastructure</li> <li>Slower innovation: Centralized control limits experimentation with open-source or alternative AI models</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Why is this problem especially relevant in the context of AI?     AI relies on massive computing power and access to sensitive data, making trust, transparency, and privacy essential.     But centralized systems create friction in all three areas:</p> <ul> <li>Black-box behavior: Internal processes are opaque and unverifiable</li> <li>Weak privacy protection: Input data can be leaked or exposed</li> <li>Limited accessibility: Open participation in AI development is restricted</li> </ul> <p>Phala addresses these challenges by: - Using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) to securely execute AI workloads - Enabling verifiable outputs via zkCompute and on-chain proofs - Creating an open, decentralized AI ecosystem where computation is transparent and censorship-resistant</p> <p>In a world where AI is reshaping economies, governance, and daily life, these problems\u2014and their solutions\u2014are becoming more critical than ever.</p> </li> <li> <p>\ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c     \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c Phala Network\uac00 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 AI \uc5f0\uc0b0\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc559\ud654 \ubc0f \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud55c\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.     \ud604\uc7ac \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 AWS, Google Cloud \ub4f1 \uac70\ub300 \uc911\uc559 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4:</p> <ul> <li>\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c5\uc810\uc801 \ud1b5\uc81c</li> <li>\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uce68\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8</li> <li>\ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \ud22c\uba85\uc131</li> <li>\ud2b9\uc815 \uc815\ubd80\ub098 \uae30\uad00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uac80\uc5f4 \ubc0f \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131</li> </ul> <p>AI\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc73c\uba74\uc11c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c, \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, AI \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p> </li> <li> <p>\uae30\uc874(\uc911\uc559\ud654) \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4     \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud615 AI \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4:</p> <ul> <li>\uac80\uc5f4 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131: \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uc815\ubd80\uac00 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ub610\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc784\uc758\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c</li> <li>\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub178\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8: \uc911\uc559 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uba70, \ud574\ud0b9\u00b7\uc624\ub0a8\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611 \uc874\uc7ac</li> <li>\ud22c\uba85\uc131/\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubd80\uc871: AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc0b0\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5</li> <li>\ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub3c5\uc810 \uad6c\uc870: \uace0\ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc6b4\uc601\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc18c\uc218 \ub300\uae30\uc5c5\ub9cc \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\uc785 \uac00\ub2a5</li> <li>\ud601\uc2e0 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558: \uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \ud1b5\uc81c \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud568</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>AI \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c \uc911\uc694\uc131     AI\ub294 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uc0b0\ub825\uacfc \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc791\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uac00 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.     \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4:</p> <ul> <li>AI\uc758 \u2018\ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\u2019 \ubb38\uc81c: \ub0b4\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0</li> <li>\ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \ubd80\uc871: AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc785\ub825\ub418\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131</li> <li>\uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc131 \ubd80\uc871: \ub204\uad6c\ub098 AI\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568</li> </ul> <p>Phala Network\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, -

Why Blockchain","text":"<ol> <li>Why Does This Problem Require Blockchain? Phala tackles problems deeply embedded in centralized AI systems: privacy vulnerabilities, lack of trust, opaque processes, and potential censorship. Blockchain provides the structural capabilities to overcome these issues:</li> <li>Tamper-proof Execution and Logging: Every computation, data access, and AI model interaction is immutably recorded on-chain, preventing any party from secretly modifying histories or results. This transparent execution ledger ensures sensitive data is processed correctly\u2014and can be verified.</li> <li>Trustless Collaboration: Users and developers don\u2019t need to trust any central intermediary. Blockchain enables peer-to-peer interaction, reducing risk of fraud, data abuse, or censorship by centralized authorities.</li> <li> <p>Automated, Enforceable Incentives: Smart contracts ensure that all actors\u2014data providers, model developers, node operators\u2014are automatically compensated according to rules. Such trustless, programmable reward systems are nearly impossible in traditional off-chain setups.</p> </li> <li> <p>What Does Blockchain Enable That Traditional Solutions Cannot? Censorship Resistance: No single actor (e.g., government, company) can block access to models, freeze assets, or remove services arbitrarily. This is critical as AI becomes embedded in finance, communications, and personal infrastructure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verifiable Processing: Through cryptographic proofs and TEE attestation, users don\u2019t need to take the platform\u2019s word\u2014they get on-chain proof that computation was secure and private.</p> </li> <li>Open Participation &amp; Programmability: Anyone can join the network, deploy models, or build on existing services without permission. Traditional platforms restrict participation to selected partners\u2014blockchain removes that barrier.</li> <li> <p>Transparent Data/Model Usage: Who used which dataset, how the model behaved, and how incentives were distributed\u2014all of it is recorded permanently on-chain. This enhances auditability, regulatory compliance, and scientific reproducibility</p> </li> <li> <p>Is Decentralization Critical in This Use Case? Absolutely. Decentralization is fundamental to the integrity and fairness of Phala\u2019s AI ecosystem:</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevents Monopoly &amp; Abuse: Centralized AI gives disproportionate power over data, access, and governance to a few corporations. Decentralization distributes this control, reducing bias, privacy violations, and monopolistic outcomes.</p> </li> <li>Enables User Sovereignty: With decentralized custody and computation, users can control their data, decide what to share or monetize, and avoid surveillance-driven business models.</li> <li>Improves Resilience: Distributed networks are more resistant to downtime, cyberattacks, or political interference\u2014no single point of failure can halt critical AI services.</li> <li>Fosters Innovation: A decentralized, open ecosystem attracts a diverse global contributor base, encourages experimentation, and accelerates breakthroughs through permissionless, community-driven development.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"reports/phala/#8-insights-limitations","title":"8.

Background &amp; Problem Statement","text":"<p>What real-world problem does this project aim to solve?</p> <p>The current AI landscape suffers from centralized ownership where only big tech companies capture value from AI systems. When millions of users interact with ChatGPT, provide feedback, and create content, all the economic benefits flow exclusively to OpenAI while users get nothing despite contributing to the system's improvement^1.</p> <p>What are the limitations of existing (centralized) approaches?</p> <p>Traditional AI systems have three major limitations:</p> <ol> <li>No User Ownership: Users contribute data and feedback but receive zero equity or revenue sharing when AI companies succeed</li> <li>Limited Autonomy: Current AI agents can't own assets, make payments, or operate independently across platforms</li> <li>Siloed Systems: AI assistants can't collaborate with gaming NPCs or social media bots, wasting potential synergies</li> </ol> <p>Why is this problem especially relevant in the context of AI?</p> <p>As AI becomes the foundation of digital interaction, the ownership structure will determine whether we get decentralized innovation or concentrated corporate control. Without fixing this now, we risk creating permanent digital feudalism where a few companies own all AI while everyone else pays subscription fees forever. The AI agent economy could be worth trillions - the question is whether communities participate in that value or just consume it.</p>"},{"location":"reports/virtuals/#3-how-it-works","title":"3.

KarinekoAI's token is $NEKO, which means that the people who own this token co-own the agent.

The way trading works is that the price is determined by the bonding curve like the AMM DEX, so I saw some price changes in the $NEKO tokens early on. This seems to be similar to the trading that happens early on when a meme coin is issued, where trading bots, rather than humans, are tracking the creation of the agents, and once they're created, they're trying to make a profit by buying and selling the initial volume. Anyway, this literally made the KarinekoAI agents co-owned.

Why Blockchain","text":"<p>Why does this problem specifically require blockchain to be solved well?</p> <p>Blockchain is essential for three reasons that traditional systems cannot address:</p> <ol> <li>Trustless Revenue Sharing: Without blockchain, users must trust companies to fairly distribute AI profits.

Smart contracts automatically execute revenue sharing without human intervention or corporate decisions.</li> <li>True Agent Autonomy: Blockchain enables AI agents to own wallets and execute transactions independently. Traditional systems require human approval for every payment, preventing genuine autonomous operation.</li> <li>Cross-Platform Persistence: Blockchain-based identity lets AI agents maintain consistent personas across gaming, social media, and business applications. Traditional systems lock AI into single platforms.</li> </ol> <p>What does blockchain enable that traditional solutions cannot?</p> <ul> <li>Cryptographic Guarantees: Revenue distribution happens automatically through code, not corporate promises</li> <li>Permissionless Innovation: Anyone can create AI agents without platform approval</li> <li>Composable Services: AI agents can hire other AI agents across different platforms seamlessly</li> <li>Community Governance: Token holders vote on AI development rather than corporate executives making all decisions</li> </ul> <p>Is decentralization critical in this use case?</p> <p>Yes, because centralization creates the exact problem being solved.

However, this approach has several issues: it often involves the collection and storage of personal information without user consent, allows individuals to create multiple identities, and lacks interoperability across national borders. Furthermore, since a centralized authority controls the data, it creates a single point of failure \u2014 which can lead to access restrictions, censorship, or system outages. Privacy protection is also difficult, as cross-service data linking poses risks of tracking and exposure.</p> <p>Example of a conventional approach: India's Aadhaar system is the world\u2019s largest centralized digital identity system, based on biometric data such as fingerprints and iris scans. However, it has experienced multiple data breaches over the years, and reports have indicated that personal information of over 800 million Aadhaar users has been traded on the dark web. The centralized structure, where the UIDAI directly stores and manages all biometric data, creates a single point of failure (SPOF), exposing the entire system to risk in the event of a security breach.

Why Blockchain","text":"<p>The core problem World ID seeks to solve is preventing individuals from creating multiple identities to exploit systems, and stopping AI bots from pretending to be human. Effectively addressing this \"Proof of Personhood\" issue requires more than technical implementation\u2014it demands a trustworthy system architecture.</p> <ul> <li>Why does this problem require blockchain? In centralized systems, identity data is collected, stored, and verified by a single authority. This poses risks such as privacy violations, censorship, data leaks, system failures, and abuse of power. In contrast, blockchain provides a trustless architecture where anyone can independently verify the validity of identity proofs, and it prevents any single entity from monopolizing or tampering with the data.</li> <li>What capabilities does blockchain offer that existing solutions cannot? Blockchain, combined with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), enables users to prove they are human without revealing their identity, ensuring strong privacy protection. Moreover, all activities\u2014including WLD token distribution, usage history, and verification traffic\u2014are immutably recorded, which is essential for ensuring fair rewards and maintaining system integrity.</li> <li>Is decentralization essential for this use case? Why? Yes, decentralization is not optional\u2014it is a prerequisite. If a system is designed to ensure one identity per person, but that identity can be controlled or revoked by a government or corporation, the entire purpose of the system is undermined. To guarantee an identity that belongs to no one and is controlled by no one, World ID adopts a globally accessible and censorship-resistant blockchain infrastructure.</li> </ul> <p>Ultimately, World ID does not merely use blockchain\u2014it makes decentralization the foundation of its trust, privacy, and reward systems. This structure simply cannot be replicated within a traditional centralized framework.</p> <p>WorldID\uac00 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub294, \ud55c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098, AI \ubd07\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc778 \ucc99 \ud65c\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c '\uc0ac\ub78c\uc784 \uc99d\uba85(Proof of Personhood)' \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.</p> <ul> <li>\uc65c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294\uac00?   \uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\uad00\uc774 \uc218\uc9d1\u00b7\ubcf4\uad00\u00b7\uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc0dd\ud65c \uce68\ud574, \uac80\uc5f4, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc624\ub958, \uad8c\ud55c \ub0a8\uc6a9 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ub4a4\ub530\ub978\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\ub098 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc99d\uba85\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubb34\uc2e0\ub8b0(trustless) \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\u00b7\ubcc0\uc870\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc758 \ub3c5\uc810 \ud1b5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc6d0\ucc9c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud55c\ub2e4.</li> <li>\uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc740?   \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85(ZKP)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \"\uc0ac\ub78c\uc784\"\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, WorldID\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c WLD \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec, \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d, \uc778\uc99d \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub4f1\uc740 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc704\ubcc0\uc870\uac00 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uae30\ub85d\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.</li> <li>\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub294 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778\uac00? \uc65c \uadf8\ub7f0\uac00?   \uc608, \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \u2018\uc120\ud0dd\u2019\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \u2018\uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74\u2019\uc774\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \ub2e8 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \uadf8 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc815\ubd80\u00b7\uae30\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ucde8\uc18c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74, \uc774\ub294 \uace7 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \ucde8\uc9c0\uc640 \ubaa8\uc21c\ub41c\ub2e4.

Blockchain enables programmatic, wallet-to-wallet transfers without intermediaries.</li> <li>Micropayment Economics: Legacy payment rails have minimum fees of $0.30+ that make micropayments economically impossible.

Blockchain transactions provide instant finality in ~200ms with no possibility of reversal.</li> <li>Global Accessibility: Blockchain operates permissionlessly worldwide, unlike traditional banking that excludes 1.4 billion unbanked people. This enables truly global AI agent commerce.</li> <li>Programmable Money: Blockchain enables smart contracts and programmable payment logic that can automatically handle complex payment scenarios without human intervention.</li> <li>Trustless Verification: The protocol needs cryptographic proof of payment that both parties can verify independently, which traditional systems cannot provide.</li> <li>Decentralization Critical: For AI agents to operate autonomously across the internet, they cannot depend on centralized payment processors that might restrict access or require human approval.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/x402/#8-insights-limitations","title":"8.

It was a surprise that a critical section such as payments - might be dealt with using AI agents as well as the humans do.</p> <p>But clearly, approaches on application of AI Agents in financial tasks should be done more catiously, and I personally think human intervention (or at least audit by human) is necessary for now.</p> <p>Also, I still have a doubt on the criticisms on traditional payment rails that x402 whitepaper suggests - that subscription model and human-centric payment system are not profitable for not only machines, but also to human.  Traditional payment systems had a lot of developments to provide customer protection from the fraud or scams. To replace those payment systems, x402 or any other payment system using blockchain should also try to have such protection or any overperforming </p> <p>By the way, I could also learn that traditional human verification steps such as CaptCha is successfully limiting the AI agents from working with digital transactions.</p> <p>Also it was a first trial for me to use Gemini CLI and integrating MCP server, it was a amazing experience that I had, and now I know how to integrate my own MCP server.</p>"},{"location":"reports/x402/#discussion-questions","title":"\u2753 Discussion Questions","text":"<ol> <li>Autonomous Agent Economics: If AI agents can make payments independently, what new economic models and business opportunities emerge?

The goal is to share and discuss the report with students in class so that they can learn from each other and deepen their understanding. The results are not only shared in class, but also published externally so that students can interact and contribute outside of class. </p>"},{"location":"#30-curated-aiblockchain-case-studies","title":"\ud83d\udcc2 30+ Curated AI+Blockchain Case Studies","text":"<p>AI and blockchain technologies have their own strengths and there are many areas where they can synergize. In particular, blockchain is a trust engine that can solve many of AI's problems. We divided the areas where the two technologies can synergize into five categories and selected around six projects from each category. Students will each choose one project, research and analyze it, and publish a markdown report on this site.</p>"},{"location":"#week-3-crypto-sdk-chain-support-for-ai","title":"Week 3 \u2013 Crypto SDK &amp; Chain support for AI","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) GOAT SDK \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Coinbase AgentKit \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Solana Agent Kit \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 GOAT Gaming \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-4-decentralized-ai-infrastructure-modeldata-gpu-sharing","title":"Week 4 \u2013 Decentralized AI infrastructure (model/data, GPU sharing)","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) Sahara AI \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Grass ($GRASS) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Bittensor ($TAO) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 NATIX ($NATIX) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Render Network ($RENDER) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Yupp \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 AIOZ ($AIOZ) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-5-stablecoins-payment-rails-for-ai-agents","title":"Week 5 \u2013 Stablecoins &amp; Payment rails for AI agents","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) Halliday \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Nevermined \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Agent Commerce Kit (ACK) by Catena \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Skyfire \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 0xSplits \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Coinbase x402 \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-6-proof-of-personhood-identity-rails-for-ai","title":"Week 6 \u2013 Proof of personhood &amp; identity rails for AI","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) World ID \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Solana Attestation Service \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Human Passport \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Humanity Protocol \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 BrightID \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Civic \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"#week-7-ai-agent-co-ownership-and-decentralized-ai","title":"Week 7 \u2013 AI agent co-ownership and Decentralized AI","text":"Project Author Report (EN) Report (KR) Virtuals Protocol ($VIRTUAL) \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 ElizaOS \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Kaito \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 OLAS \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 Phala Network AI \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4 NANDA: The Internet of AI Agents \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udcc4"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>about</p>"},{"location":"course/","title":"Course","text":"<p>course</p>"},{"location":"project/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>project</p>"},{"location":"report/","title":"Report","text":"<p>report</p>"},{"location":"test/","title":"Test","text":"<p>This is the first doc. * test1 * test2 * \ud55c\uae00\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5</p> <p>\uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud568 This is the test + \uc218\uc815\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud574\ubcfc\uae4c~</p> <p>Gari Test =&gt; 2\ucc28 \uc218\uc815</p> Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Text Text Text <p></p>      \ud83d\udc4d \uc774 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\uac00 \uc720\uc775\ud588\uc5b4\uc694         \ud83d\udc4e \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574\uc694"},{"location":"reports/","title":"Overview","text":""}]}

## 1. 🧩 Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?
One of the most inconvenient aspects of traveling abroad is currency exchange. Since you cannot purchase goods without exchanging currency, you must exchange currency, and in order to reduce the exchange fees incurred in the process, you must endure the hassle of finding a place with low fees. Not to mention the inconvenience of having to exchange currency again into the local currency every time you visit a different country.

## 2. 💡 Solution: Your Proposed Approach
However, if you can use cryptocurrency, all these inconveniences disappear. However, currently, cryptocurrency is typically used for online payments via heavy equipment like computers, making it unsuitable for travel. Therefore, by combining cryptocurrency with FinTech methods to introduce an offline, real-time payment system using cryptocurrency, you could make payments without exchange fees simply by holding your phone logged into a cryptocurrency-linked account, no matter which country you visit.

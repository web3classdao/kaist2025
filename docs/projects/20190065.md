## 🗂️ Project Overview
- **Student ID:**  20190065
- **Name:**  Kim Kihwan
- **Project Title:**  Immortal Gaming
- **Summary (3–4 sentences):**  
  'Immortal Gaming' is a decentralized system that allows a game to operate without a developer or publisher. By using blockchain technology to replace servers and AI agents to take on the role of developers, the game can be sustained indefinitely. This system can be applied to online games that use an in-app payment business model. Unlike P2E (Play-to-Earn) games, this system does not provide a way for players to monetize.

## 1. 🧩 Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?

Unlike in the past, a great number of modern games require servers. This has led to many games disappearing due to publishers unilaterally discontinuing their services. While users initially understood this as an unavoidable situation, game prices have risen, with some AAA titles now costing over ₩100,000. It's also common to see players who have spent thousands of wons on in-app purchases in live service games. As more gamers are negatively affected by game service shutdowns, the "Stop Killing Games" movement has started, beginning in Europe. However, permanently operating a game is extremely difficult because managing clients, maintaining servers, and creating content all require people and significant resources.

## 2. 💡 Solution: Your Proposed Approach

Immortal Gaming uses blockchain and AI agents to manage clients, operate servers, and generate content as follows:

- All clients are open-source to ensure they can be maintained continuously even if the original developer stops working on them. However, players must use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to verify the integrity of the client every time they run it.
- A blockchain network is used to perform tasks that would normally be handled by a server (e.g., item trading, in-game currency transactions, in-app payments). The token used for this is called IGT (Immortal Gaming Token). Items are issued as NFTs and can only be traded using IGT. Since Immortal Gaming seeks to avoid the P2E model, IGT cannot be traded for other cryptocurrencies. However, players can obtain IGT by paying stablecoins to an AI agent.
- An AI agent learns from the content created by the developers to autonomously and continuously generate new content.

## 3. 🔗 Why Blockchain (and Token)?

- Using blockchain allows direct ownership to be transferred to players, so they can own their items permanently.
- Fair item trading is possible based on smart contracts.
- By using a token called IGT, the in-game economy is protected from hacking threats.

## 6. 🤔 Reflection & Future Work

While working on this project, I realized there are many factors to consider when introducing a new token.
Currently, this project can only be applied to games with an in-app purchase business model. In the future, I would like to develop it to be applicable to various genres and business models.

# üöÄ Bill the Accountant: On-Chain Bill Splitting Agent

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
- **Student ID:** 20180603
- **Name:** Ï†ïÏäπÏû¨ (Seungjae Chung)
- **Project Title:** Bill the Accountant - Decentralized Bill Splitting Agent
- **Summary (3‚Äì4 sentences):**  
  Bill the Accountant is a blockchain-based bill splitting application that enables automated, transparent peer-to-peer debt management through Discord conversations. 
  The system combines AI-powered natural language processing with smart contracts to automatically detect expenses mentioned in chat messages and create appropriate debt proposals. 
  Users can discuss expenses naturally (e.g., "I paid $50 for pizza for me, Alice, and Bob") and the bot intelligently proposes debt splits on-chain, 
  requiring debtor confirmation for transparency. 
  All debts are managed through a on-chain netting system that maintains net balances between user pairs to enable users to send only the eliminated amount for convenience.

## 1. üß© Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?

**Real-World Problem:**
Traditional bill splitting among friends and groups suffers from several critical inefficiencies:

- **Manual Tracking Overhead:** People must manually remember, calculate, and track who owes what to whom across multiple expenses
- **Lack of Transparency:** Existing solutions like Venmo or Splitwise are centralized, creating trust issues and single points of failure
- **Context Loss:** Current systems don't preserve the original conversation context that led to expense agreements
- **Complex Multi-Party Settlements:** When multiple people owe money to each other, settling becomes mathematically complex and bothersome. (for example, 'Ïπ¥Ïπ¥Ïò§ Ï†ïÏÇ∞ÌïòÍ∏∞' requires users to send for all bill splitting even though they can be eliminated)
- **Command-Based Interfaces:** Existing digital solutions require users to break natural conversation flow to input structured data

**Technical Limitations of Existing Solutions:**
- Centralized platforms can manipulate or lose transaction history
- No immutable audit trail of debt agreements
- Manual entry prone to human error and disputes
- Limited integration with natural communication channels
- Complex settlement calculations done off-chain without transparency

**Why This Problem is Worth Solving:**
Money-related disputes damage relationships and trust. By automating expense detection from natural conversations and maintaining transparent, immutable records on blockchain, we can eliminate the friction and trust issues in group financial management while preserving the social context of shared expenses.

## 2. üí° Solution: Your Proposed Approach

**Core Solution Architecture:**
Bill the Accountant combines three key technologies to create a seamless bill-splitting experience:

1. **AI-Powered Natural Language Processing:** Uses Google Gemini AI to analyze Discord chat messages and automatically detect expenses, identify who paid, and determine appropriate participants for bill splitting
2. **Smart Contract Debt Ledger:** Implements sophisticated on-chain debt netting that maintains net balances between user pairs, reducing gas costs and simplifying settlements
3. **Discord Bot Interface:** Provides both automated detection and manual command interfaces, with comprehensive permission handling and error recovery

**How AI & Blockchain are Combined:**

**AI Integration:**
- **Message Analysis:** Gemini AI processes chat history to identify expense-related conversations
- **User Mapping:** Intelligent mapping between Discord usernames and blockchain addresses
- **Context Understanding:** AI determines bill splitting participants based on conversational context (e.g., "we all had dinner" includes everyone mentioned)
- **Expense Extraction:** Automatically parses amounts, currencies, descriptions, and payment responsibilities

**Blockchain Integration:**
- **Propose-Confirm Workflow:** All AI-detected expenses create on-chain debt proposals requiring debtor confirmation
- **Automatic Debt Netting:** Smart contract automatically nets opposing debts between user pairs
- **Immutable History:** Complete audit trail maintained via contract events
- **Multi-Token Support:** Handles ETH, USDC, and other ERC20 tokens with proper decimal precision

**System Workflow:**
1. Users have natural conversations about expenses in Discord
2. AI detects bill-splitting opportunities and maps usernames to blockchain addresses
3. Smart contract creates pending debt proposals on-chain
4. Debtors receive DM notifications with accept/reject options
5. Confirmed debts are automatically netted in the on-chain ledger
6. Users can settle debts directly with ERC20 token transfers

## 3. üîó Why Blockchain (and Token)?

**Why Blockchain is Necessary:**

**1. Immutable Audit Trail:** Traditional bill-splitting apps can modify or delete transaction history. Blockchain ensures permanent, tamper-proof records of all debt agreements and settlements.

**2. Elimination of Intermediaries:** No central authority can freeze accounts, change terms, or extract fees. Users maintain full control of their financial relationships. This also profits by allowing users to send money regardless of the time - for traditional bank accounts, it is impossible to send money near midnight.

**3. Transparent Settlement Logic:** The debt netting algorithm runs on-chain where all parties can verify calculations. No "black box" settlement systems.

**4. Cross-Platform Interoperability:** Debt records exist independently of any single application, enabling future integrations with other platforms or wallets.

**5. Low Transaction Fees:** Modern financial superapps such as KakaoPay and Toss sometimes requires transaction fee (although they are mostly discounted from promotions). Using blockchain and allowing any ERC-20 tokens to be used allows users to exchange money with very low fee.


**Token Strategy:**
The current implementation does **not** use a custom token, instead leveraging existing ERC20 tokens (ETH, USDC) for several strategic reasons:

- **Real Economic Value:** Users can settle debts with tokens that have actual market value
- **No Token Launch Complexity:** Avoids regulatory concerns and token economics design
- **Immediate Utility:** Works with tokens users already own
- **Network Effect:** Compatible with existing DeFi ecosystem

**Future Token Considerations:**
A future governance token could enable:
- Voting on system upgrades and parameters
- Incentivizing AI training data contributions
- Rewarding early users and community building
- Enabling decentralized protocol governance

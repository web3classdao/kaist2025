# üöÄ Onchain Quest ‚Äî Daily Micro-Rewards

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
- **Student ID: 20210364**  
- **Name: Yang Seungmin**  
- **Project Title: Onchain Quest ‚Äî Daily Micro-Rewards**  
- **Summary (3‚Äì4 sentences):**  
  Onchain Quest is a prototype P2E service that converts short daily quizzes into on-chain micro-rewards. Users complete a one-minute off-chain quiz, obtain an EIP-712 signed claim ticket, and submit that ticket via a relayer (meta-transaction) to receive ERC-20 tokens or occasional ERC-721 NFTs ‚Äî all with minimal gas friction. AI assists with personalized quiz generation and fraud detection, while blockchain provides transparent, auditable reward settlement.

## 1. üß© Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?
- Clearly describe the real-world or technical problem you are addressing.
    - Many reward or learning apps want to convert lightweight user actions (micro-tasks) into verified on-chain events, but onboarding friction (wallet setup, gas fees) and UX complexity keep non-crypto users away. Even when users complete off-chain tasks, they often skip on-chain claims because of gas cost or confusion.
- What are the limitations or inefficiencies of existing solutions?
    - Existing P2E or micro-reward systems either force users to hold native tokens (gas) or rely on custodial off-chain accounting that lacks transparency. Solutions that subsidize gas are costly and hard to scale without careful economics. Many projects also lack automated anti-abuse mechanisms tailored to low-value, high-frequency tasks.
- Why is this problem worth solving?
    - Reducing onboarding friction and reliably converting lightweight engagement into on-chain activity unlocks broader adoption of blockchain UX, enables transparent incentive systems for education / micro-learning / community tasks, and provides verifiable proof-of-participation for DAOs, research, or loyalty programs.

## 2. üí° Solution: Your Proposed Approach
- What is your proposed solution, and how does it work?
    - Onchain Quest combines a minimal UX with a meta-transaction flow: users complete a short off-chain quiz ‚Üí the backend issues an EIP-712 claim ticket ‚Üí the user signs the ticket (or receives a server-issued signed ticket) ‚Üí the ticket is submitted to a relayer which pays gas and calls claimReward(...) on the smart contract. The contract verifies the signature and claimId to prevent replay and transfers the reward.
- How are AI & Blockchain combined in your approach?
    - **AI for content & personalization**: a light AI module generates daily quiz items, tailors difficulty per user, and rotates content to maintain engagement.
    - **AI for fraud detection**: a lightweight model scores suspicious activity patterns (fast repeated completes, identical answers, abnormal timing) so the relayer or backend can flag or throttle claims.
    - **Blockchain for settlement & audit**: final reward distribution is settled on-chain (ERC-20 / ERC-721), which provides immutable proof of reward allocation and prevents disputes.

## 3. üîó Why Blockchain (and Token)?
- Why is blockchain necessary in your solution?
    - Blockchain provides transparent, tamper-proof settlement of rewards. This is important for verifiability (proof of participation), for enabling trustless distribution of scarce NFT rewards, and for future interoperability with DAOs or on-chain reputation systems.
- What problem does blockchain specifically solve in your context?
    - It removes ambiguity about who received rewards, allows external parties to validate participation, and enables composability (e.g., turning earned tokens into governance weight or NFT access).
- If you designed a token, what is its purpose (e.g., incentive, governance, reputation)?
    - Optional token design: An ERC-20 utility token used for small rewards and a limited ERC-721 series for special achievements. Tokens serve as immediate incentives; future work may add token staking for governance or premium features. (In the current prototype we focus on reward distribution; governance is out of scope.)

## 6. ü§î Reflection & Future Work
- What did you learn during this project?
    - Removing gas friction meaningfully increases claim conversion in simulation. The meta-tx design is promising for non-crypto users, but operational and economic constraints (relayer cost, fraud mitigation) are central to real deployability.
- What were the biggest challenges?
    - Designing a secure but low-friction signature flow (EIP-712 nuance).
    - Balancing believable simulation assumptions against real user variability.
    - Planning sustainable relayer economics without enabling abuse.
- What would you improve or build next if you had more time?
    - Build an actual Sepolia pilot with a small real user group to validate assumptions.
    - Implement a production relayer with budget controls and throttling.
    - Integrate a lightweight ML model (server side) for live bot detection and AB testing for reward sizing.
    - Conduct a security audit and refine token economics (if tokens are to be persistent).

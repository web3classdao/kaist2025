# 🚀 AuctionDash

## 🗂️ Project Overview

- **Student ID: 20220093**
- **Name: 김문정 Moonjung Kim**
- **Project Title: AuctionDash**
- **Summary (3–4 sentences):**
This decentralized delivery platform aims to disrupt the dominance of centralized delivery apps by creating a fair and transparent ecosystem. It introdueces an auction-based delivery fee system and user-governed ecosystem. It is built on Solana for low fees and high throughput.

## 1. 🧩 Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?

Current delivery platforms exert disproportionate influence over restaurants, couriers, and customers, limiting their autonomy and negotiation power.

- Service fees and commission rates lack transparency, making it unclear how costs are calculated or distributed.
- Proprietary algorithms often favor certain vendors or couriers, creating biased visibility and order allocation.
- Transaction and customer data is fully controlled by centralized platforms, leaving participants with limited access, minimal transparency, and no control over how their data is used.
- Couriers often face low pay, unstable income, and limited protections, with little say in setting rates, schedules, or working conditions.

## 2. 💡 Solution: Your Proposed Approach

**1. Auction-Based Delivery Fee**

- The restaurant owner sets a baseline fee they are willing to pay the courier.
- The customer can add an optional tip or incentive to increase the fee for faster delivery.
- The courier reviews the total offered fee and decides whether to accept the job.

**2. Community Governance**

- Restaurants, customers, and couriers earn governance tokens based on their on-chain activity.
- These tokens grant voting rights to propose and approve protocol changes that shape the platform’s rules and policies.

## 3. 🔗 Why Blockchain (and Token)?

- **Prevent Centralized Power Concentration:** Eliminate the risk of a single company dominating once it captures a large user base.
- **Ensure Transparent Pricing:** Make all fees, commissions, and payments verifiable on-chain, removing hidden charges.
- **Empower Actual Users:** Give restaurants, customers, and couriers direct governance power to shape platform rules.

I build on Solana because it has low transaction fees and high throughput, so therefore real-time auctions and micro-payments can be fast and affordable for all participants.

## 4. 🛠️ MVP or Prototype

- Current status:
■ Idea only ☐ Prototype ☐ Working MVP
- Key features you implemented
    - Customer side UI that lets user use GUI to choose restaurant, food, and delivery fee and make a smart contract out of the choice
    - Tried on importing metamask android sdk
    - Instead, I used Solana's Mobile Wallet Adaptor

- I also submitted to Colosseum Eternal, but I realized it takes 4 weeks to complete the submission and submitted to QuSat Group Hackathon 2025 instead.

## 6. 🤔 Reflection & Future Work

### Reflection

- I should have focused more on the smart contract and less on the interface. I would have made much more progress.
- Finding references for the MetaMask Android SDK was harder than I expected.

### Future Work

- Complete the three-participant smart contract and ship an MVP.
- Add a governance token as a follow-up enhancement.

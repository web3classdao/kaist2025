# 🚀 School Point System

## 🗂️ Project Overview
- **Student ID: 20250017**  
- **Name: 강재환**  
- **Project Title: School Point System**  
- **Summary (3–4 sentences):** The School Point System is a system that evaluates students' behavior and attitude. This is a blockchain-based school point management system that ensures transparent and tamper-proof merit/demerit records. An integrated AI module predicts point trends, offers personalized guidance, and detects unusual patterns to support fair and effective student management.

## 1. 🧩 Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?
- **Data Manipulation Risk** – Administrators or insiders could alter or delete records without leaving a trace.
- **Lack of Transparency** – Students, parents, and even teachers cannot independently verify if records are accurate.
- **Dispute Resolution Difficulty** – When conflicts arise, proof of the original record is difficult to establish.
- **Server Downtime Risk** – If the central server fails or crashes, point assignments and historical records cannot be issued or recovered, leading to permanent data loss.

## 2. 💡 Solution: Your Proposed Approach
I propose a Blockchain-based School Points Management System integrated with AI-driven insights.

**Blockchain Layer**
- All point transactions (plus/minus) are recorded on a public or permissioned blockchain.

**AI Layer**
- **Point Trend Prediction** – AI analyzes historical merit/demerit data to forecast each student’s point trajectory, identifying those who may soon cross critical thresholds (e.g., suspension or reward eligibility).
- **Personalized Guidance** – Based on prediction results, AI recommends tailored actions for each student (e.g., encouragement messages, mentoring suggestions, or corrective programs).
- **Pattern Recognition** – Detects unusual activity, such as sudden large penalties from a single source, which may indicate bias or errors.

Each record is immutable and timestamped, ensuring no one can secretly modify it.

**Workflow Example**

1. Teacher submits a point adjustment request via the web app.
2. Valid transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability.
3. Students, parents, and teachers can view the real-time point history and AI-generated guidance in the dashboard.
4. AI updates the student’s projected point graph and generates any necessary guidance suggestions.

## 3. 🔗 Why Blockchain?
- **Immutability** – Once recorded, points cannot be altered or deleted without creating a transparent audit trail.
- **Transparency** – All authorized users can view the same source of truth.
- **Decentralization** – Eliminates the risk of single-point failure or unilateral data control.

In this case, the system does not require a cryptocurrency token because the focus is on record integrity and transparency, not economic incentives.

## 6. 🤔 Reflection & Future Work

### **Learnings**
I have learned about some key terms in Solana development

#### PDA (Program Derived Address)
- A special address generated by a Solana program that cannot be owned by a regular private key. It is commonly used for program-owned accounts and ensures predictable, secure account addresses.

#### Localnet / Devnet / Mainnet
- Localnet: A locally run Solana cluster for testing without network fees or internet connection.
- Devnet: A public Solana test network with free tokens for development and testing.
- Mainnet: The live Solana network where real SOL is used and transactions have real-world consequences.

#### Rent-Exempt
- In Solana, accounts must maintain a minimum balance to remain active. If an account’s balance meets the rent-exempt threshold, it will not be charged periodic rent fees and will persist indefinitely.

### **Biggest Challenges**
#### Structing Data Structures
- To minimize the rent-exempt fee on Solana, I had to design and optimize the account data structure efficiently while ensuring it still met all functional requirements.

### Future Improvements
#### Studying About Rust
- I plan to deepen my understanding of Rust to write more efficient, secure, and maintainable Solana programs.

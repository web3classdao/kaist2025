## 1. Term Project Idea
The final project doesn't have to be big - it can be a proposal for applying blockchain to AI applications, utilizing AI in a blockchain service, or any form of combining AI and blockchain. We recommend checking out AI x Blockchain hackathons to get some ideas for your project. Here's a list of some of the best hackathons to check out

* Solana AI Hackathon

The project deliverable can be prototype code or a proposal. The important thing is that it is in a form that can be submitted to a hackathon or grant program.

## 3. Term Project Presentation
At the last class(8/13), you will be required to present your final project results. You will have 5 minutes to introduce a project. I'll provide you with a markdown template for your project report. You can use that report for your final presentation. You must show your submission to the hackathon/grant program during your final presentation to have your project accepted as complete.

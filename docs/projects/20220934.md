# üöÄ AI-Powered Decentralized News Verifier

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
- **Student ID: 20220934**  
- **Name: Belay Zeleke**  
- **Project Title: AI-Powered Decentralized News Verifier**  
- **Summary (3‚Äì4 sentences):**  
  This project proposes an AI and blockchain‚Äìbased solution to combat the spread of misinformation online. AI models will analyze news articles to detect potential fake or misleading content, while blockchain will provide a transparent, tamper-proof record of verification results. This combination aims to make fact-checking faster, more accessible, and immune to centralized control or manipulation.

## 1. üß© Problem: 
Problem: Misinformation spreads rapidly through social media and news outlets, shaping public opinion and potentially leading to harmful real-world consequences. Traditional fact-checking processes are slow, centralized, and often perceived as biased.

Limitations of existing solutions:

Rely heavily on centralized fact-checking authorities.

Lack transparency in the verification process.

Updates or retractions can be hidden or altered over time.

Why worth solving: Misinformation undermines trust in institutions, polarizes communities, and can cause harm in areas like public health, elections, and finance. A transparent, decentralized approach can restore trust in information integrity.

## 2. üí° Solution: The Proposed Approach
Proposed solution:
We will design a system where AI automatically scans articles, evaluates credibility using NLP-based fact-checking techniques, and stores a permanent verification record on the blockchain. Users can check any article‚Äôs trustworthiness in seconds.

How AI & Blockchain are combined:

AI handles content analysis: detecting misleading patterns, cross-referencing facts with trusted data sources.

Blockchain handles trust and permanence: storing the verification results and preventing tampering.

## 3. üîó Why Blockchain (and Token)?
Why blockchain:

Ensures verification results cannot be altered or deleted.

Allows anyone to independently verify an article‚Äôs authenticity.

Blockchain‚Äôs role in this context:

Serves as a permanent, transparent ledger of fact-checking results.

Decentralizes trust so no single authority controls the verification process.

Token design (optional):

A governance/reputation token could incentivize expert validators and community participation.

Token holders could vote on disputed AI decisions to refine accuracy.

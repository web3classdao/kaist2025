# 🚀 HyperX — Web3 Medical Image Labeling with Transparent Rewards

## 🗂️ Project Overview
- **Student ID:** 20240310
- **Name:** [Jimin Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/지민-박-984931301)
- **Project Title:** HyperX — Web3 Medical Image Labeling with Transparent Rewards
- **Summary (3–4 sentences):** 
  HyperX is a Web3 platform where medical experts label ultrasound/CT/MRI images and receive transparent, algorithmic rewards. We combine a tier system with base pay, performance pay, and contribution bonuses; add meta-review for disagreements; and use verification items, consistency checks, and invisible watermarks for trust and safety. Users log in with a wallet and see staking, rewards, and pool share on a dashboard. A Zero-Cost mode lets anyone experience the full flow without gas, while Anvil mode runs the same dApp on a local chain.

## 1. 🧩 Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?
- Quality medical labels are scarce and slow to produce; traditional outsourcing has opaque quality, timelines, and incentives.
- There’s no standardized, auditable way to translate expert effort and difficulty into fair rewards.
- Enterprises need provable trust (QC, audit trails) and strong data-leak safeguards.

---

## 2. 💡 Solution: Your Proposed Approach
- Core design
    - Reward mechanics: Base pay (tier & volume brackets) + performance pay (correctness × tier weight) + contribution bonus for “hard” items (accuracy-rate inverse × base). Final payouts come proportionally from a Reward Pool.
    - Trust stack: Verification items (easy, repeatable), consistency scoring, meta-review when agreement < 90%, stake/escrow to deter careless work, and invisible watermarking to prevent leaks.
    - Task routing: Rules/cluster-based recommendations (later RL/bandits) to match experts to tasks by skill and history.
- UX
    - Wallet login → How it works explainer → Label tasks (public demo images) → Consensus/meta-review → Claim → Dashboard shows rewards, stake, and pool share.
- (Optional) Include a diagram to show the system architecture or workflow.

## 3. 🔗 Why Blockchain (and Token)?
- **Transparent settlement**: Immutable, queryable records for submissions, agreement, and payouts.
- **Aligned incentives**: On-chain reward pool, staking/escrow, and tiered economics minimize ambiguity and disputes.
- **Token (future)**:
    - Utility/reward token for payouts & staking.
    - Governance token for voting on rules (tiers, thresholds, pool splits).
- **Cost control today: Zero-Cost simulation** (off-chain) for demos; Anvil mode for local on-chain testing.

## 4. 🛠️ MVP or Prototype
- Current status: ☑ Working MVP (Zero-Cost & Anvil modes)
  ☐ Idea only ☐ Prototype ☐ Working MVP  
- Key features you implemented (1–2 short paragraphs)
    - Solidity contracts: LabelingHub (register/stake/consensus/meta-review/claim), MockUSDC (test token), Reward Pool split (base/performance/contribution).
    - Frontend (Next.js + wagmi/viem): Wallet login, How it works page, task labeling with web-fetched demo images, dashboard for rewards/stake/share, Faucet and Claim.
    - Zero-Cost mode: Full off-chain simulation, identical UX with no gas.
    - Testing: Foundry unit/property tests for economics; Playwright E2E for wallet-mock → label → claim.

## 6. 🤔 Reflection & Future Work
- What did you learn during this project?
    - How to encode incentive design (base pay, performance pay, contribution bonus, staking) directly in smart contracts and reflect it cleanly in the UI.
    - Practical Web3 product lessons: wallet UX friction, the value of a Zero-Cost simulation mode, and keeping sensitive data off-chain while settling rewards on-chain.
    - Using Foundry + Anvil for rapid Solidity iteration and wagmi/viem for a reliable wallet + contract front end.
    - How consensus, meta-review, and verification items can turn ambiguous medical labels into auditable outcomes.
    - **Broader understanding of the Web3 ecosystem—trade-offs around cost, transparency, governance, and compliance considerations.**

- What were the biggest challenges?
    - Designing incentives so labelers work diligently and enterprises still find pricing/payouts economically reasonable.
    - Ensuring label quality at scale (consistency checks, verification items, and meta-review thresholds) without creating a heavy UX.
    - Balancing transparency with privacy/security (watermarking, access control, de-identification).
    - Keeping the stack cohesive (contracts ↔ frontend ↔ tests) and maintaining reproducible local runs
- What would you improve or build next if you had more time?
    - Web2 backend for enterprises: traditional login, DB, and an upload portal so clients can securely submit image sets; full audit logs and access control.
    - A stronger on/off-chain bridge: queue jobs off-chain, commit results/proofs on-chain, and batch settlements to cut costs.
    - Smarter task routing (RL/bandits), richer reviewer tools, and better analytics for label quality and contributor reputation.
    - Privacy hardening: stricter de-identification checks, invisible watermark tuning, and role-based redaction.
    - Gas & UX polish: AA/paymasters, further Zero-Cost simulations, and more E2E tests for wallet flows and claims.

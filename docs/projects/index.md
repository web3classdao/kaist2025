This page is a collection of students' term projects. To pass the class, each student must create a service or idea that combines AI and blockchain and submit it to a hackathon or grant program. It's a short 8-week course, so the projects may not be perfect. However, by the end of the course, students should have gotten some hands-on experience with AIxBlockchain.

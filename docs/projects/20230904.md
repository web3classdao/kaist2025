# üöÄ RepuCard - AI-Powered Wallet Reputation Cards

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
- **Student ID:**  20230904
- **Name:**  Ïã†Ïû¨ÏòÅ
- **Project Title:**  RepuCard - AI-Powered Wallet Reputation Cards 
- **Summary (3‚Äì4 sentences):**  
  RepuCard is a Web3 service that analyzes wallet addresses and creates AI-generated reputation cards that can be minted as NFTs or SBTs (Soul Bound Tokens) on-chain. The platform combines Anthropic Claude AI for intelligent activity pattern analysis with blockchain technology to provide comprehensive reputation scoring across DeFi, NFT, governance, trading, and stability metrics. It leverages Alchemy's unified API for multi-chain support.

## 1. üß© Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?
- **Trust and reputation verification in Web3:** Traditional Web3 interactions lack reliable reputation systems, making it difficult to assess the credibility and activity patterns of wallet addresses before engaging in transactions or collaborations.
- **Fragmented on-chain data:** Wallet activity data is scattered across multiple blockchains and platforms, making comprehensive analysis time-consuming and technically challenging for average users.
- **Limited transparency:** Current solutions either provide raw transaction data that's difficult to interpret or simple metrics that don't capture the full picture of a wallet's behavior and risk profile.
- **Manual due diligence:** Users must manually check multiple sources and tools to verify wallet legitimacy, which is inefficient and prone to missing critical red flags like honeypot interactions or scam involvement.

## 2. üí° Solution: Your Proposed Approach
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet to analyze 90 days of on-chain activity and generate human-readable reputation summaries with intelligent pattern recognition.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Leverages Alchemy's unified API to analyze activity across Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and other networks from a single interface.
- **Comprehensive Scoring:** Calculates reputation scores across 5 key areas: DeFi participation, NFT activity, governance engagement, trading behavior, and wallet stability.
- **Risk Detection:** Automatically identifies dangerous interactions with honeypots, scam contracts, and suspicious trading patterns.
- **On-Chain Verification:** Mints reputation cards as ERC-721 NFTs or SBTs on Base network with IPFS metadata storage for permanent, verifiable records.

## 3. üîó Why Blockchain (and Token)?
- **Immutable Reputation Records:** Blockchain ensures reputation cards cannot be tampered with or falsified, creating a permanent trust layer for Web3 interactions.
- **Verifiable Credentials:** On-chain storage allows anyone to verify reputation claims independently without relying on centralized authorities.
- **Interoperability:** NFT/SBT format enables reputation portability across different DApps, marketplaces, and protocols in the Web3 ecosystem.
- **No Custom Token:** The project doesn't use a custom token as reputation is inherently tied to wallet behavior rather than token ownership, keeping the focus on authentic activity analysis rather than tokenomics.

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è MVP or Prototype
- Current status:  
  ‚òê Idea only ‚òë Prototype ‚òê Working MVP  
- Key features implemented:
This includes a fully functional Next.js 15 web application with wallet connection via RainbowKit/Metamask, multi-chain transaction analysis through Alchemy SDK, AI-powered reputation scoring across 5 categories, risk detection for honeypots and scams, visual reputation card generation, and IPFS metadata storage preparation. The system can analyze 90 days of wallet activity across multiple networks and generate comprehensive reputation reports with both numerical scores and AI-generated summaries.

## 6. ü§î Reflection & Future Work
**What did you learn during this project?**
- Integration of AI and blockchain technologies requires careful consideration of data flow and cost optimization
- Multi-chain analysis presents both opportunities and complexity in terms of API management and data consistency
- User experience design for Web3 applications must balance technical sophistication with accessibility

**What were the biggest challenges?**
- Standardizing transaction analysis across different blockchain networks with varying data structures
- Designing meaningful reputation metrics that accurately reflect wallet behavior without being easily gamed

**What would you improve or build next if you had more time?**
- Deploy smart contracts for actual NFT/SBT minting functionality on Base mainnet
- Implement historical reputation tracking to show reputation evolution over time
- Add social features for reputation verification and community validation
- Develop API endpoints for other DApps to integrate RepuCard scores
- Create reputation-based matching systems for DeFi protocols or NFT marketplaces

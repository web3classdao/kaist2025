# 🚀 On-Chain Election Promise Verification Platform
**On-Chain Election Promise Verification Platform**  
*(AI-powered system to track election promise fulfillment and record results on blockchain)*

## 🗂️ Project Overview
- **Student ID:** 20210403 
- **Name:**   Jihyun Yoo
- **Project Title:** On-Chain Election Promise Verification Platform  
- **Summary (3–4 sentences):**  
  This platform transforms election promises into **structured claims**, collects **evidence** from news articles, press releases, and public datasets, and uses AI to automatically match and evaluate **status** and **progress**.  
  The core results (status, progress, confidence, version hash) and **evidence bundle hash (IPFS/Arweave)** are stored on the blockchain (EVM) to ensure **immutability** and **auditability**.  
  Anyone can view a dashboard showing candidate, party, or policy-specific progress, and disputes are handled transparently through **DAO governance (Snapshot)**.  
  The goal is to create a **fact-based, auditable record** of election promise fulfillment, free from political bias.

## 1. 🧩 Problem: What Problem Are You Solving?
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ONNYtuel.png)

- **Real-world issue:**  
  After elections, the progress of campaign promises is scattered across fragmented news and government announcements, with a high risk of bias or misrepresentation.  
  Voters lack an easy, consolidated view, while journalists and NGOs struggle to maintain consistent, evidence-linked evaluations.
- **Limitations of existing solutions:**  
  - PR-focused performance reports often lack **traceability**  
  - Spreadsheet or document-based tracking lacks **version control** and **auditability**  
  - Existing fact-checking platforms rarely integrate **on-chain immutability** and **governance-based corrections**
- **Why it matters:**  
  Standardizing promise tracking with **evidence-based, tamper-proof records** allows the public, media, and researchers to debate from the same dataset, enhancing democratic accountability.

## 2. 💡 Solution: Your Proposed Approach
- **Core idea:**  
  1) Extract structured claims (action, target, KPI, deadline) from campaign promises using **Claim Extraction**.  
  2) Collect and normalize evidence from news, press releases, and government datasets, scoring trustworthiness (C2PA signatures, publisher credibility, source diversity).  
  3) Calculate **progress** (based on KPI achievement rates) and **confidence** (based on source credibility, consistency, freshness).  
  4) Store the evidence bundle on IPFS/Arweave, and commit the **root hash (Merkle/DAG)** and summary (status, progress, confidence, model version) **on-chain**.  
  5) Handle disputes via **DAO governance (Snapshot)** with transparent challenge and update flows.
- **AI & Blockchain integration:**  
  - **AI:** NLP-based claim extraction, entity linking, event detection, evidence scoring with hybrid rule+LLM methods  
  - **Blockchain:** Immutable storage of result summaries and evidence hashes, governance records for dispute resolution
- **Architecture Diagram (ASCII):**

## 3. 🔗 Why Blockchain (and Token)?
- **Why blockchain is needed:**  
  - **Immutability:** Locks evaluation summaries, versions, and evidence hashes in an unalterable record  
  - **Auditability:** Records who/when/what was uploaded with on-chain timestamps  
  - **Governance:** Uses on-chain voting (Snapshot) for disputes and corrections
- **Problem blockchain solves:**  
  Removes reliance on a single trusted operator and guarantees permanent traceability of evaluation history.
- **Token design (optional):**  
  - **Initial phase:** No token, governance via Snapshot + **Reputation (Soulbound)** system  
  - **Extended phase:** Introduce small **stake & slash** mechanism for fact-checkers, and governance/reputation token if needed  
  - **Why optional:** For early-stage public/academic prototypes, blockchain can serve its purpose without a native token

## 6. 🤔 Reflection & Future Work
- **What I learned:**  
  - Political/policy text often contains **ambiguity**, to make it reliable -> deliberate design choices 

Future Work
- If possible, Implement with Korean sample political sources and publish public.

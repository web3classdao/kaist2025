### üìå Summary  
Human Passport is a Web3-based system that allows individuals to own and control their **digital identity** using blockchain technology. Instead of relying on governments or centralized entities, users manage their identity and selectively prove it when needed. ***It‚Äôs not a passport for international travel*** ‚Äî the Human Passport is simply a way to prove that you are a real human.

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

#### Currently, how do websites trust my identity?

- **Most digital identity systems today are controlled by centralized platforms such as Google, Facebook, or Apple.**
- Many websites rely on these services for authentication through options like ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù or ‚ÄúContinue with Facebook.‚Äù
- In this model, users don‚Äôt own their identity‚Äîthey depend on third-party providers to vouch for them.

#### Can we trust companies to handle our identity data?

- **Users have no control over how their identity is stored, used, or revoked.**
- Centralized identity systems require us to fully trust corporations to manage our personal information.
- These companies may sell user data for advertising or share it with third parties without transparency.
- If a central server is hacked or compromised, millions of user identities can be leaked.

#### Centralized systems cannot tell if we are human or AI.

- **These systems typically verify accounts, not people.**
- Fake email addresses, phone numbers, or social media profiles can be generated in bulk by bots or malicious actors.
- AI agents can now bypass CAPTCHAs and simulate human-like behavior, making it harder than ever to distinguish real users from artificial ones.
- As a result, centralized systems offer poor bot resistance and lack a reliable mechanism for proof of personhood.

## 3. How It Works

### üîç 3.1 Project Approach  
1. **Core Idea**: Create a decentralized identity system that allows individuals to prove they are real humans using Web3 technologies.  
2. Users maintain ownership over their identity and verification data, which is cryptographically secured.  
3. Once verified, users receive a non-transferable "Human Passport" that proves their humanness on-chain.
4. This can be used across Web3 platforms to enable human-gated access, reputation systems, and secure AI interactions.

### üèóÔ∏è 3.2 Architecture  
- Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture.  
- Include a diagram or describe the components and how they are connected.  
- Focus on how data flows between users, models, smart contracts, etc.

---

### üéØ 3.3 Core Components  
- Describe the key components or modules (e.g., data capsule, model registry, token system)

---

### üîÅ 3.4 Workflow Overview  
Explain the overall process or user flow in 3‚Äì5 steps.

Example:
1. A user uploads their data...
2. The model interacts with the data via zero-knowledge proofs...
3. The contributor is rewarded with tokens...

> *(You may include a diagram or link to an official architecture diagram if helpful.)*

## 4. Token Economy *(if applicable)*

> *Include this section **only if the project has its own token.***  

- What is the name and type of the token? (e.g., utility, governance, staking)  
- What can the token be used for within the ecosystem?  
- How does the token incentivize key actors (e.g., contributors, validators, users)?
- Is there a burn/mint mechanism, inflation cap, or vesting schedule?  

| Stakeholder | How They Use / Earn the Token |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Provider | [e.g., earns rewards based on contribution] |
| Model Developer | [e.g., pays tokens to access datasets] |
| Verifier / Node | [e.g., earns tokens by verifying data provenance] |

## 5. Project Status & Plan


#### Current Development Stage

The project is currently in the beta phase, with core features implemented and undergoing community testing. The team has released a public testnet and is inviting users to try out the identity verification flow using mock data or limited biometric inputs.
A mainnet launch is planned for Q4 2025, pending results from the beta phase and audit feedback.

#### Adoption

Several Web3 DApps (including governance DAOs and reputation systems) are experimenting with Human Passport integration for bot-resistant access. Adoption is still early, but several open-source contributors are involved in building wallet integration tools and ZK verification modules.

## 6. User Experience & Hands-on Review *(if applicable)*

> *Try to actually use the project if possible ‚Äî via a demo, public app, testnet, or simulation.*
> This section should capture your experience **as a user or a developer**, not just as a researcher.

Here are some prompts to help you reflect:

- What features did you explore? 
- What did you do step-by-step?
- Was the onboarding intuitive or confusing? 
- How did you deal with a crypto wallet or tokens?
- What felt different from traditional (non-blockchain) services?
- What worked well? What didn‚Äôt?

You can also include:
- Screenshots
- Links to testnet/demo activity
- Errors or bugs you encountered

## 7. Why Blockchain

* **Self-sovereign identity**: Users own and control their credentials via their wallets. No third party can modify or revoke them.
* **Immutable proofs**: Once a Human Passport is issued on-chain, it cannot be forged or altered.
* **Interoperability**: Verified identity can be reused across multiple decentralized applications (DAOs, social networks, on-chain voting, etc.)
* Transparent verification logic: Smart contracts handle the issuance and validation of credentials transparently, with no hidden rules or bias.
* Bot resistance: On-chain uniqueness (e.g. 1 passport = 1 verified human) can help mitigate Sybil attacks without sacrificing user privacy.

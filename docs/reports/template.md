## 1. Overview

- **Project Name**:  
- **Category**: [e.g., Decentralized AI Infrastructure, AI Payment Rails, etc.]  
- **Key Technologies / Platforms**: [e.g., Solana, Bittensor, Sahara AI, ZKML, etc.]  
- **Official Links**:
  - Website:
  - Whitepaper:
  - Docs: 
  - GitHub: 

### üìå Summary  
Briefly describe what problem this project is solving and how it is using blockchain to solve the problem. Then summarize the project's achievements and key takeaways.

---

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

- What real-world problem does this project aim to solve?  
- What are the limitations of existing (centralized) approaches?  
- Why is this problem especially relevant in the context of AI?

---

## 3. How It Works

### üîç 3.1 Project Approach  
- How does this project intend to solve the problem defined in Section 2?  
- What is the **core idea** behind the solution?  
- What makes this approach different from existing methods?

### üèóÔ∏è 3.2 Architecture  
- Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture.  
- Include a diagram or describe the components and how they are connected.  
- Focus on how data flows between users, models, smart contracts, etc.

### üéØ 3.3 Core Components  
- Describe the key components or modules (e.g., data capsule, model registry, token system)

### üîÅ 3.4 Workflow Overview  
Explain the overall process or user flow in 3‚Äì5 steps.

Example:
1. A user uploads their data...
2. The model interacts with the data via zero-knowledge proofs...
3. The contributor is rewarded with tokens...

> *(You may include a diagram or link to an official architecture diagram if helpful.)*

---

## 4. Token Economy *(if applicable)*

> *Include this section **only if the project has its own token.***  

- What is the name and type of the token? (e.g., utility, governance, staking)  
- What can the token be used for within the ecosystem?  
- How does the token incentivize key actors (e.g., contributors, validators, users)?
- Is there a burn/mint mechanism, inflation cap, or vesting schedule?  

| Stakeholder | How They Use / Earn the Token |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Provider | [e.g., earns rewards based on contribution] |
| Model Developer | [e.g., pays tokens to access datasets] |
| Verifier / Node | [e.g., earns tokens by verifying data provenance] |

## 5. Project Status & Impact

> *In this section, summarize the current state of the project and its real-world impact (if any).*

- Is the project live? In alpha, beta, or still in development?
- Does it have an active user base or developer community?
- What partnerships, grants, or investments has it received?
- Is it open source? How active is the GitHub repo (if available)?
- Is the token (if any) listed and traded? What is its current market activity?

You don‚Äôt have to cover everything ‚Äî focus on what seems most relevant to evaluating how ‚Äúreal‚Äù or impactful the project is right now.

> üìå *Try to distinguish between hype and actual traction. Just because a project looks good on its website doesn't mean it's being used or adopted.*

---

## 6. User Experience & Hands-on Review *(if applicable)*

> *Try to actually use the project if possible ‚Äî via a demo, public app, testnet, or simulation.*
> This section should capture your experience **as a user or a developer**, not just as a researcher.

Here are some prompts to help you reflect:

- What features did you explore? 
- What did you do step-by-step?
- Was the onboarding intuitive or confusing? 
- How did you deal with a crypto wallet or tokens?
- What felt different from traditional (non-blockchain) services?
- What worked well? What didn‚Äôt?

You can also include:
- Screenshots
- Links to testnet/demo activity
- Errors or bugs you encountered

---


## 7. Why Blockchain

- Why **does this problem specifically require blockchain** to be solved well?  
- What does blockchain enable that traditional solutions cannot?  
- Is decentralization critical in this use case? Why or why not?  

> üìå *This section should show that blockchain is not just "used," but "necessary."*

---

## 8. Insights & Limitations

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- What did this project do right?  
- What important lessons or patterns can we learn from this project?

### ‚ö† Limitations / Open Questions
- What challenges remain? (technical, legal, usability, etc.)  
- Are there any scalability or adoption concerns?

---

## 9. Reflections & Discussion

### üí° Personal Reflections
- What did you find most interesting or surprising?  
- How has your understanding of AI/blockchain changed after studying this?

### ‚ùì Discussion Questions
- [Thought-provoking question to ask during class]  
- [Optional: comparison to other projects in this space]

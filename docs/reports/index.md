# 🗂 AI x Blockchain Case Study Reports

As part of this course, KAIST students selected and analyzed some of the most prominent AI × Blockchain projects. Each report follows a common structure based on a shared [report template](./template.md), covering technical architecture, token design (if applicable), user experience, and current status.

These reports are the result of student research and learning, not professional due diligence. They are intended for educational purposes only.

All reports are written in **English**, which is the primary language of the course. Some reports may include a **Korean version**, written optionally by students who chose to provide a translated version for broader accessibility.

> ⚠ **Disclaimer:**  
> - These reports **do not constitute investment advice or endorsement** of any project.  
> - Some content may be **incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated**, as it reflects the understanding and interpretation of student authors at the time of writing.  
> - Readers are encouraged to explore official project documentation and do their own research before making any decisions.

We hope this collection helps others explore the emerging intersection of AI and blockchain with curiosity and critical thinking.

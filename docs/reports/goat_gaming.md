## 2. Background & Problem Statement

Since 2021, many P2E (Play-to-Earn) games have been released. These games mint cryptocurrencies and NFTs for in-game items, allowing players to earn real income.

Consider the case of Axie Infinity, an Ethereum-based blockchain game developed in 2018. It gained massive popularity in the Philippines. One of the reasons is that many Filipinos lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic and turned to Axie Infinity as an alternative source of income. At its peak, around 40% of Axie Infinity players were Filipino. However, as the value of cryptocurrencies declined, player earnings fell below the minimum wage. As a result, the average daily player count dropped from 2.5 million to just 25,000.

Thus, the P2E model faces several challenges:

1. High entry barrier
2. Uncertainty in the value of digital assets
3. Inconsistent income due to token price fluctuations
4. Unsustainable systems dependent on new user inflow
5. Long time required to generate meaningful profit

---

## 3. How It Works

### 🔍 3.1 Project Approach  

GOAT Gaming addresses the above challenges through the following strategies:

1. Using Telegram as the platform
2. Fixing the amount of unlocked tokens
3. Supporting USDT withdrawals
4. Diversifying revenue sources (e.g., in-app purchases)
5. Providing AI agents that can play games autonomously

---

### 🏗️ 3.2 Architecture

- AlphaAI helps reduce development time

#### Inside GOAT Gaming

- AlphaGOATs are powered by AlphaAI

---

### 🎯 3.3 Core Components  

GOAT Gaming consists of three main components:

Steps to earn rewards:

1. Participate in games (either manually or via AlphaGOATs)
2. Win games to earn Crowns and Tickets
3. Redeem Crowns for USDT or $GG, or use Tickets in raffles

---

## 4. Token Economy

### 4.1. $GG
 
![GG Flow](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryoQDkYHlx.png)

| Stakeholder | Usage                             | Earning Method               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| AI Agent    | Locks \$GG while operating        | Unlocks \$GG after operation |
| Player      | Converts to USDT or boosts income | Wins games and earns prizes  |
| Developer   | Pays license fee for AlphaAI      | Earns from in-app purchases  |


#### AI Agent

AlphaGOATs are AI agents that automatically earn $GG tokens. Accessing higher-tier agents requires staking more tokens.

#### Player

Players earn $GG tokens and other rewards by playing games. Tokens can be withdrawn to USDT at any time. Players can also spend TON for advantages during gameplay.

#### Developer

Developers use AlphaAI to create and publish games, but must pay licensing fees in $GG.

- XP boosts
- AlphaGOATs upgrade rights

## 7. Why Blockchain

GOAT Gaming adopts blockchain technology for the following reasons:

- Ensures true ownership of in-game items
- Prevents inflation through limited NFT supply
- Enables transparent management

These elements increase trust among users.

---

## 8. Insights & Limitations

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- A fully functioning Web3 ecosystem has been built
- AI integration lowers the barrier to entry for players and developers

### ⚠ Limitations / Open Questions

- GOAT Gaming's AI is still under early-stage development
- Only 7 games are currently available
- Fixed-token unlocking could lead to supply exhaustion without mint/burn mechanisms

---

## 9. Reflections & Discussion

### 💡 Personal Reflections

- I was impressed that GOAT Gaming chose to build an entire ecosystem instead of just a single P2E game.
- I learned that Telegram is becoming popular not only as a messaging app but also as a Web3 gaming platform. Thanks to TON, handling cryptocurrency is much easier.
- I think the concept of a fully autonomous AI agent could be a game-changer.
- I thought blockchain tokens in P2E games would always collapse due to inflation, but unlocking a fixed amount of existing tokens rather than minting new ones could be a solution.

### ❓ Discussion Questions  

1. Axie Infinity failed as player income dropped to unsustainable levels. Do you think GOAT Gaming can provide players with a significant and sustainable source of income?
2. P2E games are illegal in South Korea, as they are classified as gambling. Should they be legalized? If so, how is GOAT Gaming different from gambling?
3. Some argue that P2E games are essentially mining with graphics. Do game quality and variety matter in this ecosystem?
4. Established platforms already have large user bases. As a developer, would you choose GOAT Gaming? If not, what would need to change?

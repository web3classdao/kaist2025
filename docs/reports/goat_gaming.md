## 2. Background & Problem Statement

Since 2021, lots of P2E(Play to Earn) game are published. They mint crypto currency and NFT for in-game items. So, players can earn actual money by playing games.
Let me use 'Axie Infinity' as an example. Axie Infinity is an Ethereum-based blockchain game developed in 2018. It was a hot issue in Phillipin because lots of filipino lost there jobs due to COVID-19 and their labor was too cheep. At one point, about 40% of Axie Infinity player was filipino. However, as value of crypto currency decrease, Axie Infinity player's income is lower than minimum wage. Now, average daily player drop down from 2.5M to 25k.
So, there are problems to P2E game.

1. It has high initial barrier to entry.
2. Value of digital assets in game can be vary.
3. Income is not consistent because the value of token is usually unstable.
4. System is not sustainable because it relies on new player.
5. It takes lots of time to make profit.

## 3. How It Works

### üîç 3.1 Project Approach  

1. It use Telegram as a platform.
2. The amount of unlocked token is fixed.
3. It supports withdrawal to USTD.
4. It is pursuing revenue diversification like In-App Purchase fee.
5. It provides AI Agent which can play game itself.

### üèóÔ∏è 3.2 Architecture  


![GG Flow](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryoQDkYHlx.png)

**Players**

Player gets prizes including GG tokens by playing game.
They can withdraw their tokens to USTD in any time.
To get advantage in the game, player spends credits like TON.

**AlphaGOATS**

AlphaGOATS is an AI agent that earns GG tokens automatically.
To access higher agent, it requires more GG tokens.

**Gaming System**

Gaming system services games through Telegram.
Game system offers tokens to the winner.
If In-App Purchase occurs during the game, those revenueu goes to developer and system charges some fee to increases the value of GG token.

**3rd Party Developer**

They can make game by using AlphaAI tools and upload it to system but this action requires GG tokens as a license fee.

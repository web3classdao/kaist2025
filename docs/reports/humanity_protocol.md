### üìå Summary  
Humanity Protocol (HP) is an open identity verification layer for Web3.

---

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

Identity is a fundamental right, but centralization, surveillance, and AI are threatening it. In Web‚ÄØ2.0, platforms like Google and Facebook built convenient infrastructures but ended up wielding vast control over personal data, raising serious privacy concerns.

Even in Web‚ÄØ3.0, privacy issues remain unresolved, with the core challenge being Sybil attacks.

**What is a Sybil attack?**  
Creating multiple fake personas to exploit a digital network. Blockchains defend against Sybil attacks at the consensus level (e.g., Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëWork), but most applications lack sufficient protection. In other words, nothing stops one person from submitting multiple ‚Äúvalid‚Äù identities, which threatens on‚Äëchain voting systems like dApps or DAOs. A robust identity framework to prevent these attacks is still missing.

Furthermore, with generative AI now able to produce biometric data nearly indistinguishable from real humans, we need reliable methods to prove ‚ÄúI am actually human.‚Äù

## 3. How It Works

### üîç 3.1 Project Approach  
Humanity Protocol (HP) takes a new approach to address the fundamental flaws of existing PoP (Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëPersonhood) systems. Traditional PoP methods often rely on centralized data, leading to privacy violations and dystopian surveillance concerns. HP overcomes these limitations with its Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëHumanity (PoH) mechanism, putting user privacy first.

PoH doesn‚Äôt just answer ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù It focuses on two core questions:

1. **Are you a Unique Human?**  
   Verifies that you are a non‚Äëduplicated human on the network.

2. **Are you who you say you are?**  
   Confirms that the identity you claim (e.g., your Human‚ÄëID NFT) truly belongs to you.

HP places great importance on integrating AI technology with its own hardware. In particular, developing and deploying deep learning models for biometric authentication is key to enabling accurate, efficient human proofs while preserving privacy.

### üèóÔ∏è 3.2 Architecture  
The Humanity Protocol architecture is organized into three layers:

**User Interface Layer**  
- **Components**: Web/mobile apps, dashboards  
- **Function**: Provides a friendly UI for registration, claim requests, and progress monitoring, interfacing with backend services.

**Protocol Layer**  
- **Components**: Decentralized database (IPFS), Ethereum blockchain nodes  
- **Function**: Validates user credentials, executes smart contract rules, and records all transactions on‚Äëchain.

**Smart Contract Layer**  
- **Components**: VCC and RBC smart contracts  
- **Function**: Automates credential issuance, reward tracking, and disbursements.

### üéØ 3.3 Core Components  

**Biometric Authentication**  
Biometrics have long been a strong proof of human uniqueness, but traditional methods (fingerprint, face) are now vulnerable to AI deepfakes and widespread image availability. HP instead uses palm pattern and palm vein recognition for higher spoof resistance and accessibility.

**$H Token**
HP‚Äôs incentive system centers on the ERC‚Äë20 `$H` token, with a fixed supply of 1‚ÄØbillion and divisibility to 8 decimals. It serves as the gas token for blockchain operations and supports:

- Humanity attestation  
- Identity verification  
- Credential validation  
- Staking rewards  
- DAO governance  
- ‚ÄúCoins for Humanity‚Äù community rewards  

**Smart Contracts**  
Immutable blockchain programs that encode identity issuance and management logic, replacing centralized authorities. They automatically run registration, verification, and reward flows, ensuring transparency and tamper proofing.

**IPFS**  
The InterPlanetary File System, a decentralized file protocol that stores metadata off‚Äëchain, preventing any single entity from holding all data and enhancing censorship resistance.

**Ethereum Nodes**  
By leveraging the established Ethereum network, HP anchors proofs and NFT minting to a secure, immutable ledger.

**Zero‚ÄëKnowledge Proofs (ZKP)**  
ZKPs allow users to prove they know certain data without revealing it. In PoH, they ensure:

- **Privacy**: Raw biometric data never leaves the device.  
- **Uniqueness**: Guarantees the biometric has not been used before.  
- **Reusability**: One proof works across multiple dApps.  
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with any ZKP‚Äëcapable platform.

**zkProofer Nodes**  
Core to HP‚Äôs self‚Äësovereign identity system, these nodes generate and verify ZK proofs off‚Äëchain, then submit rollup transactions. Participation requires a zkProofer node license. A dual‚Äëincentive model rewards operators both with staking rewards and 25% of verification fees from third‚Äëparty integrations.

### üîÅ 3.4 Workflow Overview  

![Workflow Diagram](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1kX4WIDlx.jpg)

1. **Scan & Commit**  
   User scans palm via the SDK; a cryptographic commitment is generated locally.

2. **ZK Proof Generation**  
   zkProofer node creates a zero‚Äëknowledge proof showing the commitment is unique.

3. **submitProof**  
   Proof and staking collateral are sent to the Layer‚ÄØ2 rollup smart contract.

4. **Challenge & Finalize**  
   During a 3‚Äë5 day challenge window, anyone can call `challengeProof`. If unchallenged, `finalizeProof` mints the Human‚ÄëID NFT.

5. **DApp Integration**  
   dApps check for Human‚ÄëID NFT ownership to enforce one‚Äëperson‚Äëone‚Äëvote, Sybil‚Äëresistant airdrops, or real‚Äëworld access control.

## 7. Why Blockchain

- **Intrinsic Sybil Resistance**  
  Blockchain‚Äôs immutable ledger prevents duplicate or forged Human‚ÄëID issuance, something centralized systems cannot guarantee.

- **Self‚ÄëSovereign Identity**  
  Raw biometric data stays encrypted off‚Äëchain; only commitments and ZK proofs are stored on‚Äëchain, minimizing privacy risks.

- **Programmable Money & Governance**  
  Automated staking mechanics, challenge/slashing logic, and ERC‚Äë721 NFTs enable composable identity and governance functions.

- **Global Permissionless Access**  
  Anyone with a wallet can participate, without reliance on banks or centralized ID providers‚Äîopening services to the unbanked.

- **Decentralization Is Essential**  
  Centralized control could censor proofs or exploit data. Only a fully decentralized model aligns with Web3‚Äôs permissionless ethos.

---

## 8. Insights & Limitations

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways  
- Combining palm biometrics with ZK proofs achieves high accuracy without exposing sensitive data.  
- DePIN integration aligns hardware operators with on‚Äëchain incentives.  
- Simple SDK integration and NFT issuance make it easy for developers to add one‚Äëperson‚Äëone‚Äëvote or Sybil‚Äëresistant airdrops.

### ‚ö† Limitations & Challenges  
- Distributing affordable, reliable scanners remains complex and costly.  
- Compliance with global data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA) adds legal overhead.  
- Low‚Äëlight or poor camera conditions can impair scan reliability.  
- A 3‚Äì5‚ÄØday on‚Äëchain challenge window may be too slow for real‚Äëtime use; off‚Äëchain dispute mechanisms are needed.

## 9. Reflections & Discussion

### üí° Personal Reflections  
- Palm‚Äëvein recognition felt less invasive than fingerprints or facial scans, offering a fresh privacy‚Äëcentric approach.  
- ZK proofs convincingly marry privacy with transparency, boosting trust in blockchain identity.  
- While device setup and network switching UX still need polish, the wallet‚Äësignature flow is vastly simpler than traditional KYC.  
- I look forward to real‚Äëworld DePIN use cases‚Äîlike secure building access‚Äîmaking blockchain identity seamless in everyday life.

### ‚ùì Discussion Questions  
1. **Decentralized Scanner Deployment**  
   - How can affordable, reliable scanners be distributed globally?  
   - Could public venues or mobile pop‚Äëup stations help?  
2. **Governance & Power Balance**  
   - What mechanisms prevent plutocracy in Human‚ÄëID NFT voting?  
3. **Regulatory & Ethical Considerations**  
   - How can biometric data rights (consent, deletion) be enforced both on‚Äëchain and off‚Äëchain (GDPR, CCPA)?  
4. **Ecosystem Growth & Network Effects**  
   - What incentives will drive dApp developers and service providers to adopt PoH?  
   - How can PoH become a default option in mainstream apps (social media, gaming, finance)?

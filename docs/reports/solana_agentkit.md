### üìå Summary  
The Solana Agent Kit is a toolkit designed to enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with blockchain environments. Traditionally, AI faced limitations when handling on-chain (verified and recorded directly on the blockchain) assets, but this kit supports over 60 Solana-based actions such as token swaps, loans, and NFT minting. Key features include a plugin-based architecture, LangChain and Vercel AI SDK integration, zk-based airdrops, and both chat-based and autonomous agent modes.

---

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

- Problem to Solve: AI agents cannot effectively operate in on-chain environments, limiting their role in decentralized ecosystems.  
- Limitation of Centralized Approaches: APIs are often closed, restrictive, and do not easily integrate with Web3 protocols like DeFi or NFTs.  
- AI Relevance: With the growing number of autonomous agents, enabling direct manipulation of blockchain assets allows for automation and decentralized collaboration.

---

## 3. How It Works

### üîç 3.1 Project Approach  
- Core Idea: Provide a standardized plugin interface to let AI control Solana  
- Differentiators: Abstracts away wallet management, RPC calls, and protocol-specific logic to reduce developer burden

---

### üèóÔ∏è 3.2 Architecture  
- AI models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude)
- Various plugins (Token, NFT, DeFi, Misc, Blinks, etc.)
- Solana RPC / Wallet
- On-chain protocols (Jupiter, Raydium, Metaplex)
- User Input ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí Solana Agent Kit ‚Üí Plugin ‚Üí Solana Protocol

### üéØ 3.3 Core Components  
- Token Plugin: Transfer, issue, swap SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens  
- NFT Plugin: Minting, selling, metadata management  
- DeFi Plugin: Lending, staking, derivatives integration  
- Misc Plugin: Price queries, SNS domains, airdrops, etc.  
- Blinks Plugin: Minigames, JulSOL participation, etc.

---

### üîÅ 3.4 Workflow Overview  
AI Agent On-chain Workflow:
1. User Input  
   - Natural Language Command: `"Stake 1 SOL"`
2. AI Command Analysis  
   - Action: `Stake`  
   - Asset: `SOL`  
   - Amount: `1`  
   - Recognizes command as on-chain transaction  
3. Call Solana Agent Kit  
   - AI passes parsed result to Agent Kit  
   - Determines appropriate plugin  
4. Execute Staking Plugin  
   - Creates staking transaction  
   - Connects with user wallet and RPC  
   - Sends transaction to Solana blockchain  
5. Return Transaction Result  
   - Verifies success  
   - Returns transaction hash  
   - Gives user feedback  
6. Error Handling / Autonomy  
   - If failed:  
     - Retry  
     - Switch protocol  
     - Notify user

---

## 4. Token Economy

- No native token  
- Interacts with tokens such as $SEND (SendAI), $USDC, $JUP  
- No inherent economic incentives within Agent Kit‚Äîdepends on connected protocols

---

## 5. Project Status & Plan

- Status: Released as open-source (v2, currently usable)  
- Community: 1.4k+ GitHub stars, 700+ forks  
- Supported by: Solana Foundation, introduced at AI hackathons

## 6. User Experience & Hands-on Review *(if applicable)*

### Solana Agent Example Code (Balance Check)

```ts
import { SolanaAgentKit, createSolanaTools } from "solana-agent-kit";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  modelName: process.env.SOLANA_AGENT_OPENAI_MODEL || "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.7,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const agentKit = new SolanaAgentKit(
  process.env.SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
  process.env.RPC_URL || "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com",
  process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!
);

const tools = createSolanaTools(agentKit);
const memory = new MemorySaver();

const agent = await createReactAgent({
  llm,
  tools,
  checkpointSaver: memory,
});

const walletAddress = "Wallet Address"; // e.g. "9LKK..."

async function main() {
  const prompt = "What's my Solana wallet balance?";
  console.log(`User Input: ${prompt}`);

  const res = await agent.invoke({
    input: prompt,
    config: {
      metadata: {
        userId: "test-user-001",
        wallets: [{ address: walletAddress, chain: "solana" }],
      },
    },
  });

  console.log("Agent Response:\n", res.output);
}

main();
```

### Explored Features

- Built an AI agent connected to a Solana wallet using `SolanaAgentKit`  
- Queried wallet balance via user prompt  
- Overall workflow:  
  1. Set up LLM based on OpenAI API  
  2. Create agent using LangChain Graph  
  3. Integrate Solana toolset  
  4. Handle requests based on user wallet address  

---

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Clone `solana-agent-kit` from GitHub  
2. Configure environment variables in `.env`  
   - e.g., `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`, `RPC_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`  
3. Write `index.ts` and set up project directory  
4. Install external packages manually  
   - `solana-agent-kit`, `@langchain/openai`, `@langchain/langgraph`, `bs58`, etc.  
5. Resolve TypeScript module path issues  
   - Add `paths` settings in `tsconfig.json`  
   - Restart TS server in VS Code  
6. Migrate from outdated APIs to newer versions  
   - `createAgent` ‚Üí `createReactAgent`  
   - `Solana` ‚Üí `SolanaAgentKit`, `createOpenAITools`  
7. Final run: query and receive wallet balance response based on address  

---

### Onboarding Experience

- **Difficulty:** Medium to Hard  
- **Reasons:**  
  - Documentation mixes old (v1) and new (v2) APIs, causing confusion  
  - Gaps between error messages and official docs  

---

### Differences from Traditional Services

- Offers a new user experience: accessing blockchain data (e.g., wallet balance) via natural language  
- Compared to traditional non-blockchain API services:  
  - **Requires more configuration**  
  - **Interacts with decentralized data structures**  

---

### Strengths & Areas for Improvement

| ‚úÖ What Went Well | ‚ùå Needs Improvement |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Natural language-based user interface | Complex initial environment setup |
| Seamless wallet connection & real-time response handling | Debugging burden due to mixed API versions |
| Smooth integration between LangChain and Solana | Steep learning curve due to lack of documentation |

## 7. Why Blockchain

- Necessity: Allows AI decisions to be transparently recorded and later verified by anyone  
- Infeasible with traditional tech: execution via smart contracts, governance and economic incentives, permissionless decentralized network access  

---

## 8. Insights & Limitations

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- Plugin-based structure enables easy extension for AI developers  
- Covers a wide range of Solana protocols  

### ‚ö† Limitations / Open Questions
- No native incentive token  
- Lack of documentation for advanced features  

---

## 9. Reflections & Discussion

### üí° Personal Reflections
- Surprised by how smoothly LangChain and Solana were integrated  
- Realized the growing importance of autonomous agent interfaces in the Web3 ecosystem  

### ‚ùì Discussion Questions
- Should AI be allowed to autonomously manage wallets?  
- Who should be held accountable for AI errors or accidents?

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

- What real-world problem does this project aim to solve?  
    Phala Network addresses a fundamental issue in modern AI infrastructure: the centralization of computation and data control, and the lack of robust privacy guarantees.
    Today’s AI services are primarily operated by a few cloud giants (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), which leads to:

    - Monopolized control over data and models
    - Privacy risks for user data
    - High costs and lack of transparency
    - Potential censorship or restriction by governments or corporations

    As AI becomes critical to more aspects of society, issues such as data ownership, trust in computation, and equitable access to AI services are becoming increasingly important.


- What are the limitations of existing (centralized) approaches?  
    Centralized AI infrastructure has structural limitations:
    - Censorship and control risks: Corporations or governments can unilaterally restrict access to certain models or datasets
    - Data exposure threats: Central servers present high risks of hacking or misuse of personal data
    - Lack of transparency: Users cannot verify how models are run or what data is used
    - Cost barriers and monopolies: Only large companies can afford to operate or use enterprise-level AI infrastructure
    - Slower innovation: Centralized control limits experimentation with open-source or alternative AI models

    
- Why is this problem especially relevant in the context of AI?
    AI relies on massive computing power and access to sensitive data, making trust, transparency, and privacy essential.
    But centralized systems create friction in all three areas:
    - Black-box behavior: Internal processes are opaque and unverifiable
    - Weak privacy protection: Input data can be leaked or exposed
    - Limited accessibility: Open participation in AI development is restricted

    Phala addresses these challenges by:
    - Using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) to securely execute AI workloads
    - Enabling verifiable outputs via zkCompute and on-chain proofs
    - Creating an open, decentralized AI ecosystem where computation is transparent and censorship-resistant

    In a world where AI is reshaping economies, governance, and daily life, these problems—and their solutions—are becoming more critical than ever.

1. 해결하려는 실제 문제
    현실 세계에서 Phala Network가 주목하는 주요 문제는 AI 연산과 데이터 처리의 중앙화 및 프라이버시 보호의 구조적 한계입니다.
    현재 대부분의 AI 서비스는 AWS, Google Cloud 등 거대 중앙 클라우드 사업자에 의해 운영되고 있어 다음과 같은 문제가 발생합니다:

    - 데이터와 AI 모델에 대한 독점적 통제
    - 사용자 데이터 프라이버시 침해 위험
    - 높은 비용과 낮은 투명성
    - 특정 정부나 기관에 의한 검열 및 접근 제한 가능성

    AI가 점점 더 많은 영역에서 핵심 인프라로 자리 잡으면서, 데이터 소유권, 결과의 신뢰성, AI 접근의 민주화 문제가 점점 더 중요해지고 있습니다.

2. 기존(중앙화) 방식의 한계
    중앙 집중형 AI 인프라는 다음과 같은 구조적 한계를 가집니다:

    - 검열 및 통제 가능성: 특정 기업이나 정부가 AI 모델 또는 데이터 접근을 임의로 제한하거나 차단할 수 있음
    - 데이터 노출 위험: 중앙 서버에서 데이터가 운영되며, 해킹·오남용 등 보안 위협 존재
    - 투명성/신뢰성 부족: AI 모델이 어떻게 작동하는지, 어떤 데이터를 기반으로 연산되었는지 외부에서 검증 불가능
    - 비용 및 독점 구조: 고비용 인프라 운영으로 인해 소수 대기업만 시장 진입 가능
    - 혁신 속도 저하: 중앙화된 통제 구조는 실험적 AI 모델 개발과 오픈소스 혁신을 저해함

3. AI 맥락에서의 문제 중요성
    AI는 막대한 연산력과 민감한 데이터를 기반으로 동작하기 때문에, 신뢰성, 투명성, 프라이버시가 모두 중요한 요소입니다.
    그러나 중앙화된 시스템은 다음과 같은 제약이 존재합니다:
    - AI의 ‘블랙박스’ 문제: 내부 구조가 불투명하고 외부 검증이 어려움
    - 프라이버시 보호 부족: AI 모델에 입력되는 데이터가 외부에 노출될 가능성
    - 공정한 접근성 부족: 누구나 AI를 활용하고 개발할 수 있는 환경이 부족함

    Phala Network는 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해,
    - **신뢰 실행 환경(TEE)**을 활용해 데이터를 보호하며
    - zkCompute를 통해 연산 결과를 온체인에서 검증하고
    - 분산형 AI 생태계를 구축하여 AI의 자유로운 접근성과 투명성을 확보하려고 합니다.

    이는 AI가 사회 전반에 미치는 영향력이 커지는 오늘날, 반드시 해결해야 할 핵심 과제입니다.

### 🔍 3.1 Project Approach  
- How does this project intend to solve the problem defined in Section 2?
    Phala Network combines decentralized AI infrastructure with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to ensure privacy and trust in AI execution and data handling. Key strategies include:

    - Using TEE hardware (e.g., Intel SGX) to securely process AI tasks and sensitive data on a distributed network
    - Enabling the creation of AI-Agent smart contracts that autonomously operate in natural language across dynamic environments
    - Making all AI results verifiable on-chain, ensuring full transparency and auditability


- What is the **core idea** behind the solution?  
    Phala’s core innovation is to decentralize the entire AI pipeline — from execution and data privacy to economic incentives:
    - Secure computation without exposing sensitive data
    - Dual-layer verification: protected execution within TEE + on-chain zkProof validation
    - An AI-Agent Economy where developers can build, deploy, and monetize AI agents in a permissionless Web3 environment

- What makes this approach different from existing methods?

## 7. Why Blockchain

1. Why Does This Problem Require Blockchain?
Phala tackles problems deeply embedded in centralized AI systems: privacy vulnerabilities, lack of trust, opaque processes, and potential censorship. Blockchain provides the structural capabilities to overcome these issues:
- Tamper-proof Execution and Logging:
Every computation, data access, and AI model interaction is immutably recorded on-chain, preventing any party from secretly modifying histories or results. This transparent execution ledger ensures sensitive data is processed correctly—and can be verified.
- Trustless Collaboration:
Users and developers don’t need to trust any central intermediary. Blockchain enables peer-to-peer interaction, reducing risk of fraud, data abuse, or censorship by centralized authorities.
- Automated, Enforceable Incentives:
Smart contracts ensure that all actors—data providers, model developers, node operators—are automatically compensated according to rules. Such trustless, programmable reward systems are nearly impossible in traditional off-chain setups.

2. What Does Blockchain Enable That Traditional Solutions Cannot?
Censorship Resistance:
No single actor (e.g., government, company) can block access to models, freeze assets, or remove services arbitrarily. This is critical as AI becomes embedded in finance, communications, and personal infrastructure.

- Verifiable Processing:
Through cryptographic proofs and TEE attestation, users don’t need to take the platform’s word—they get on-chain proof that computation was secure and private.
- Open Participation & Programmability:
Anyone can join the network, deploy models, or build on existing services without permission. Traditional platforms restrict participation to selected partners—blockchain removes that barrier.
- Transparent Data/Model Usage:
Who used which dataset, how the model behaved, and how incentives were distributed—all of it is recorded permanently on-chain. This enhances auditability, regulatory compliance, and scientific reproducibility

3. Is Decentralization Critical in This Use Case?
Absolutely. Decentralization is fundamental to the integrity and fairness of Phala’s AI ecosystem:

- Prevents Monopoly & Abuse:
Centralized AI gives disproportionate power over data, access, and governance to a few corporations. Decentralization distributes this control, reducing bias, privacy violations, and monopolistic outcomes.
- Enables User Sovereignty:
With decentralized custody and computation, users can control their data, decide what to share or monetize, and avoid surveillance-driven business models.
- Improves Resilience:
Distributed networks are more resistant to downtime, cyberattacks, or political interference—no single point of failure can halt critical AI services.
- Fosters Innovation:
A decentralized, open ecosystem attracts a diverse global contributor base, encourages experimentation, and accelerates breakthroughs through permissionless, community-driven development.

## 9. Reflections & Discussion

### 💡 Personal Reflections
One of the most surprising insights from studying Phala Network was realizing that a privacy-preserving, decentralized AI infrastructure is not just theoretical—it’s live and working.

Before this, I saw blockchain mainly as a tool for transparency and security. But combining it with TEEs showed that even sensitive AI computations can be performed privately, verifiably, and without centralized control.

This project shifted my understanding of Web3: it’s not just about token economies—it’s about reshaping how we think about data ownership, access, and digital trust in the AI era.

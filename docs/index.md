# All about AI x Blockchain crossover  

This site is publicly publishing the project analysis reports and term projects of the students in the class **“Blockchain meets AI: The Trust Engine”**, which was held in the summer semester of 2025 at KAIST. This is a **Web3@KAIST** class that has been held annually at KAIST since 2023, and this year's class focuses on the intersection of blockchain and AI. The Web3@KAIST class is taught by [Jason Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaesunhan/), a longtime serial entrepreneur in the tech space.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community-based Learning

Rather than a one-sided lecture by the professor, students research and analyze projects and publish reports. The goal is to share and discuss the report with students in class so that they can learn from each other and deepen their understanding. The results are not only shared in class, but also published externally so that students can interact and contribute outside of class. 

## 📂 30+ Curated AIxBlockchain Case Studies

AI and blockchain technologies have their own strengths and there are many areas where they can synergize. In particular, blockchain is a trust engine that can solve many of AI's problems. We divided the areas where the two technologies can synergize into five categories and selected around six projects from each category. Students will each choose one project, research and analyze it, and publish a markdown report on this site.

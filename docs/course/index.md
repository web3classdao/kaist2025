# 🧠 Blockchain meets AI: The Trust Engine  
### 📅 KAIST School of Computing – Summer 2025  
**Instructor**: [Jason Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaesunhan/) | **Credits**: 1 | **Language**: English | **Grading**: Pass/Fail  

---

## 1. Course Summary

In the age of AI, the ability to *use* knowledge is more important than simply *knowing* it.  
This course provides hands-on experience in both **blockchain** and **AI**, focusing on how these technologies intersect to solve *trust problems*.

Rather than mastering technical internals like Solidity syntax, you’ll build practical intuition by exploring real-world services:  

### Course Objectives
- Get a sense of knowledge on when, why, and how to use blockchain
- Gain crypto/blockchain user experience so you can move forward on your own
- Get a sense of knowledge on how AI and blockchain intersect
- Submit a term project to a hackathon or grant program to get it running
- Build your own arsenal of blockchain skills and resume
 

The final goal: **submit your project to a hackathon or grant program** — not necessarily to win, but to connect your ideas to the outside world.


## 2. What This Course Is (and Isn’t)

**✅ This course will help you:**
- Understand when, why, and how to use blockchain in AI applications
- Gain experience with crypto-native tools and concepts
- Explore real-world AI x blockchain use cases
- Develop and share your own project 

**❌ This course does *not* cover:**
- Crypto trading or investment strategies
- Deep blockchain platform theory
- Solidity programming syntax in depth

## 5. Case Study Assignment

Each student (or team) will choose one real-world AI+Blockchain project from a curated list and write a **Markdown report** instead of slides.  
Your report will be used to present in class (around 10-20 minutes), and should:

- Be ~3–4 pages long
- Use the [📄 Report Template](./reports/template.md)
- Focus on core ideas, tech analysis, and your personal hands-on experience

## 6. Term Project

Your term project should explore a meaningful connection between AI and blockchain.  
It can be one of the following:

- A prototype or demo service
- A grant proposal or research idea
- A hackathon submission

You are encouraged to:
- Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) for assistance
- Use reliable blockchains: **Solana**, **Base**, or **Kaia**

You must:
- Present your project in Week 8 (in English)
- Submit to a hackathon or grant program before the course ends

## 7. Grading & Pass Requirements

This course is graded **Pass/Fail**. To pass, you must:

- Attend **at least 4 out of 8** classes
- Research and present one **AI+Blockchain case study**
- Complete a **final project**
- Submit your final project to a **hackathon or grant program**

> 🚫 You may fail the course if you skip core deliverables — this course is lightweight but not optional.
